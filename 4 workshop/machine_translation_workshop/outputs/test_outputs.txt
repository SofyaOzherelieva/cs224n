You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the last child for children, read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or leather clothes, and never nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell in somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of kind of circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I went to her every week in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom in the teachers.
It was doing it <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night, I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> ovarian and I'd like you to do that please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see us <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because necessary, because I was necessary, because I was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs everything the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can, he was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The <unk> around me, <unk> of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't more than thinking about a <unk> about another <unk> about a <unk>
The <unk> are born when they fall out of glaciers or the ice shelves, is <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to <unk> and they hold up to the end, while others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, in great measure as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As it melts a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique times exist in that way, and they will never exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not a end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 thousand years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to get actually to see a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the eardrum and your line of <unk>
You can see here, starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg from Greenland, the average size.
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every one -- a baby <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the understanding of it, they're not going to pay me attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome from sperm joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training, and what I study in this case is the way people who are <unk> the anatomy -- that of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids.
The other role that works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients, or as I say sometimes, we will try to <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with fraternal twins two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical typology doesn't fit up in male <unk> and conventional person.
<unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many different forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the traditional forms of male or female forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> the chromosome from the chromosome -- and he tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> that will become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> <unk> testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but not reaction.
As a result, the body develops on a course of <unk> course a female <unk>
When you <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a child, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast cancer, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like this.
Women, as men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> <unk> <unk>
Most women like I -- I consider an <unk> woman -- he doesn't know his structure -- I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the brain more exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised as <unk> I had girlfriend, and sex with her, wore a life as a guy and just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> glands were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their genitalia were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> nobody <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a <unk> case.
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in tissue tissue.
We don't know what that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> surgeries are not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that we get to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that an particular anatomy brings together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have identity <unk> <unk> being black wants to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when we presented a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children who are born as two people within a same body.
The most high case is last year with the <unk> African <unk> <unk> put in fabric of judgment and sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What test are they going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such thing.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a whole line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who mapped that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through the science, we have to admit that these categories -- we were going to admit that these categories were <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with occupational categories that are much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology will be.
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go through the science of science, we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the categories are <unk> that they are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles of the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot would put a pen in front of the nose, and he was still not going to do it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract life vital organs and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to deal with a dilemma of really really determining somebody's death, and this makes us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find that <unk> <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Founding <unk>
The Founding <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did, I was a <unk> concept, and they did it with another thing that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what we <unk> our Founding <unk> was the idea of <unk> monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were about the idea that was going to be the political power of the father passed from the grandfather to the father and then to the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And part of them were doing it because they make part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time I was going to save science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations <unk> and thereby <unk> the concept of power <unk> that goes from a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> is about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the <unk> Civil Rights Movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that we prescribe to the <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking us why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some divisions in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should do anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years we had to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some divisions of divisions for me to make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are keeping them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures -- at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 which is exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: born in March was born on March of March 1980.
For the only fact that we were born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before I had Henry -- the right to sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
So, I don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can get married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So they still have <unk> categories that in many aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science went up in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have chromosome and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do <unk> to people.
But this is also very strange given to the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
So if we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people in <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people at the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to deal with this to empower the rights to the people, because I have to admit that I know of some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some of them I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> <unk> and <unk> about their sexual relations than people of 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is it seems to be very important that America is still driving this current thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is <unk> to be <unk> unless it's willing to have a change of sex in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a little couple of years ago that I had made the light <unk> <unk> to then pick out their name.
But when the phone asked the phone, he was a <unk> operation, he told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of <unk> <unk>
America offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change the way of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as I could have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit of radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigate sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and to operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I became a feminist, as a <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what's the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
feminism has to be able to get rid of the stereotypes of your gender, so there's no female <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, I have a little bit like there is something female <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the client were very aware of us to find the way to protect people in the state, it's possible that we have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we spend democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to go live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than its building cost.
So we could easily address the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just took out for buildings for apartments.
Imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartment already were owners and that the other half is still having to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to <unk> all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas around us have rules to avoid the <unk> and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, to build a whole new apartment building, and then when the rules of that place would be <unk> instead of getting <unk>
So I proposed that governments to build new major reform zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people were going to come up from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following election of <unk> <unk> <unk> were beaten up with a platform in which we had <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most crucial ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and refuse to all the world's current residents today.
They have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies as the rules for <unk> and they're usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They call.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met it in Miami, a conference room of a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to be able to choose if they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> was called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to go to <unk> and I'd talk back about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure by least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for her talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that they might be able to go could be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them build and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add an constitutional arrangement that would create these special regions of development.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting of the voting at February 24, a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are more interested in participating in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is building in Korea in Korea is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years and getting <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they are thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow <unk> <unk> and it would allow the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has been committed to allowing her Supreme Court to be the <unk> court for this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change another place.
There are a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job -- sometimes are mothers who have to win the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what does it look like about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, what I'm going to do is make a confession for public <unk>
I love to find, literally, and more recently, to photograph and publish my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second line stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
So I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buy a personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I would like to love color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> then I feel I've won.
Going back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what about someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I am suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
It's inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now for this week.
Doesn't it sound interesting?
As I do, I'm going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit about it, too.
<unk> <unk> of the child you get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the <unk> or I remember it to their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost safe you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and the outside, you don't have to be able to <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style -- and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and again when people approached me this week just by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical one.
This would be something that is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain in this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
And I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make it, these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We have to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A lot of intuition that you may have developed with the age of the years is that it says that one thing can be just in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet this bar to play with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that big things not allow the <unk> and you stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physics, because they don't play with parking spaces, they play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of things really weird -- they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and the so-called quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of physics a few years ago, you needed from quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't work very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't work well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach, the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a shape of springboard and that <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a clean silicon chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this little hole with a swimming <unk> which is found under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for it it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it's going to be in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up with me to do those things, because I don't want to do it -- or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues in the journey of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that the <unk> and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to stick all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air, and then it would break it into a temperature of less than a degree above zero <unk>
Now, when I was only in the <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as you like.
So we measure their movements.
We discovered that they moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a smooth block, we were able to make it <unk> and that I don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean if one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom -- and that little piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you sound too?
I mean, it's my logical part of the speech.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- it claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief who is here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Lots of negotiations and stories, they were doing it with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explaining simply in this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not to me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go back to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than shows you a demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken out of their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around every museum there.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate by the <unk>
We opened up the flat, and with one click, we jumped into it.
They're inside that you want to go to the end of the hall,
Are they going to keep forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click this right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get in 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get in 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this boy, he doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to make it <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems to be <unk>
I went and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And so a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is actually hitting a <unk> with a stick, the Tuesday of <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep deep and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed you was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Van Gogh actually created this <unk> play.
It goes up and it really enhances it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online create your own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just <unk> around it.
It's about <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at the contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to your work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening.
I have something to show you.
Think about it a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, all children in Italy are growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the <unk> races in the last two decades.
So, some time ago, if you wanted to win a race of Formula 1, take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot is good enough, you had a career.
This is what it was in engineering, it was <unk> control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting <unk> computers in the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can note that the cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex -- but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are getting into our everyday objects in our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late <unk> at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the atoms that were existing to become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the external environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end, took the hammer and he threw it up the Moses -- you can actually see a little dent in it, and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of picking up the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, in the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the web.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
And in the evening there are people here and there are called <unk>
It starts a silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a car called fast and goes to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
First <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to the center.
There you see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the <unk> people going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and we consume.
Today we know everything about the background of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up one Mac, how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its change by the system.
We started with some volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, and to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, put a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same as a lot less energy.
These are data that before not existed before.
They're happening very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> doesn't just be anywhere on the planet, it's still somewhere.
If the plastic bottle we dropped a day is still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change from behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is taken on the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT in a workshop, was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write on them, to show patterns, images, texts.
And by there, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the Mayor <unk>
He liked it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows, but when you're coming up and opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little <unk> if you want to minimize the <unk> you get the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter when the ceiling, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is working.
You see the people who are going on in the way that it happens inside.
And here's me trying not to try to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was really more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to leave you to let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things for behaviors that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, which moves with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is light, not the position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D to which you can reach, and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers of today, the star of the New York City of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use them as input to <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can run all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and motion, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment as an oyster farm as a breeding farm -- but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what's remarkable that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign will be able to go from the digital world, the self-organizing power of the networks, the physical world.
In our case, this might be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something that would mean in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world in the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, form this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered from pixels.
You can move inside, and you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- it will be to share the main moments of the Olympics in 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So that's a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise up like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only changes in their genes, they might be able to improve <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in the better way, it's stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and secure for ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is most of the things that you would <unk>
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people are providing creativity?
Hands up, let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many would <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a doctor of a doctor on the subject.
The great pound of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Indian Church -- <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology, makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or of the future?
It refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course, the most interested in it.
<unk> of a common ancestry with modern chimps about six or eight million years.
There's been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have been <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it is the same protein, <unk> <unk> that comes out of it.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> gives you about the <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot warm down, it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that you can want to want no effort to get their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of <unk> <unk>
But for the other thing, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest double nutrients to <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or mean to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got them <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms, every cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two <unk> cells.
But when diarrheal organisms, things begin to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to argue that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> death for <unk> it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every single year I was going on, every time I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night, someone hits her door to hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a slight <unk> <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, he says George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily a different <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about going through the genome to the next <unk> adapted and generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level of the <unk> and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
It doesn't necessarily favors the bigger or the stronger or the most quickly and even the more intelligent people do.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish fish -- yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead and go ahead to phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that you create an evolution of traditional traditional type, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution can roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a species -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce nature.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility and intriguing and <unk>
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but it's what you pick up at the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce your risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes on their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and she sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and a week.
Not to be a lot of a lot to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but that they are going to induce immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course with the flu flu vaccine, and they are in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the newborn egg -- and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating diabetes, eliminating the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to have a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the vending machine.
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be converted to the evolution of before <unk>
We're going to take a process that I normally could carry 100 thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these options in order for a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we are going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, more <unk> or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds like this.
Well, I had a single seat on this day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
And so immediately he looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes happened at the same time.
And the pilot is <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
We put the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words <unk> I had heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
While I was thinking later on, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to have anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington, I didn't think a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've been trying to improve all I did.
But in my humanity I also gave place to my ego.
And I am sorry that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> on that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have reason to be right, and it's going to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I did, I had the sensation of, Whoa! dying not a fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children to grow.
One month later, I was in a performance performance -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> like a kid.
And to me, that was all of the reason to be the world.
At that point I get to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift that was the ability to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge that imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be -- but you can imagine, and how do you do?"
What is the thing that you're trying to do is they don't expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are being the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the world's oldest <unk>
One day he came to her home after I run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, I have complete paralysis, have a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And her brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that I was seeing Stephen <unk> it's not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be important and you have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Someone saw the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, they are doing it with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I showed up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to happen.
I was obsessed with her brother and her father right there at that moment -- "All right, this is the Tony <unk> is going to talk about, we are going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who is so much in their inner can't afford it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> Research Research, which have a technology that lets you projecting a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- draw on that and recorded the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle of life.
First of all, you start with the sex organs then with the bad words, after the attacks of Bush and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and very much move things on one side of the way to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could be able to make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy -- this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the world to come from every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the back garage, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took over the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> <unk> my son was part, my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of cheap sun cups that we bought in the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We took a <unk> camera -- we put it on a <unk> <unk> and now there's a device that is free -- -- -- -- -- -- -- you build the <unk> <unk> the software goes down in a <unk> for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that says <unk>
There is no hospital to say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. That was amazing.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of learning every night, Tony became drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine, what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to sketch in the parking lot, so we feel like we were going to be able to treat graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was saying, "This was the first time it was a <unk>
I felt like I had been under the water and someone would finally come to me and get me out of there so that I could be <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through with this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
That's why we're trying to figure out how to fix and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of prize.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends of closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that isn't possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I simply recognized something and helped me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like we need to do. If it's not right now, and if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun to the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I've been <unk> in such horrible situations with the only goal to try to examine social issues in ways that make common light, and hopefully analyzing it in a way that looked useful and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered the rights of my name of 2011.
What had been this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when I do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a headline in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had been asked by asked a year ago I would never have been allowed by certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we looked at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with me, anything that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, at beginning to end, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people have been attached to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is exploring all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's what? <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we would raise all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe I took a shoe and it becomes the coolest shoe that you've ever met.
The most great car that you've ever driven in "The largest <unk> <unk> the best drink, you <unk> from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we actually showed the full process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot and the beginning of the beginning to end.
And I would love that to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> No <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it's certainly not worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film comes out of the film is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where I will go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies actually disappeared.
None of it wanted to have nothing to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, I was to introduce the product to so many people as possible, to make so many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage with separate media, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
In fact, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that were up.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or easily detected or easily detected or easily <unk> and easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even the CEOs <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it something changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to make it <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father would join me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take a blind person and go to the companies myself.
So what I started to figure out of a sudden -- that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, big, giant films and others who make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who do with the big, big, giant Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands associated with they have.
And then my friends who do independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm trying to go, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there he gave one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the big picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a little <unk>
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that <unk> are more <unk> a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that we have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind people is the reason that this is interested in us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you fresh over time, with better <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those who would take the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my <unk>
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good job.
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's a day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing accessories like <unk> or I like <unk> and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of <unk> in part <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet <unk>
They put toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I was <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I'm often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These shape people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world is, I think your world is the world that we <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you live in your life.
All of those things come in, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: Next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your shape of be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> for what that serves us.
What's the <unk> What is that phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, who is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. Great <unk> Yes. Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> on your <unk> <unk> brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were very excited together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only become one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature to avoid the things that they are not <unk> they avoid the fear, those items, and you are actually going to sink and make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are a <unk> and <unk> brands -- those things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: What's your <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to give you your identity of brand, your brand, what would it be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a <unk> attribute <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful being playful like <unk> contemporary or bold <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk> like <unk>
Or are you more than attribute <unk>
Are you conscious aware, like <unk>
You are India, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> you <unk>
You are good, stable, familiar, <unk> <unk> sacred <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how now they use MRI resonance to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for marketing centers like <unk>
We went to San Paulo where you've banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are becoming a way in the schools with money problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that projects in which I've had the greatest answer or what I've had more success is those where I've been interacting with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be able to think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They were success?
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This covers over a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no press or TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk about giving them to their customers not being part.
I've always believed that if you take a <unk> if you take risks, that there are opportunities.
I think when you get to people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in loss of the risk that they are preparing for their own company for <unk>
I feel like what has to happen to progress is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we will move forward, I think we need to bring it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. Take the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So you know, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization -- the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance for TED on the next.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash virus from Windows in a computer -- used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray, damages <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of the <unk> the <unk> of the multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> boxes. These systems of control.
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment in which we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they went very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab of lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then of experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that place: in that
It doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It could be, let's say, for example, a power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than I would try to take your goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two tiny bombs and a small one and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They were looking at all the points to attack.
They probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech -- let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here's a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to find this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to engage them with the real world, with potential the real world.
We need theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably in Iran because it's where most infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant of <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called it and I saw them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they deal with the speed of this <unk> you can certainly be able to get it out of it, and you can even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the head of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to go back to online engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started investigating scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in front of hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out after a couple of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very upset that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we really saw, I really <unk>
That's the gray, and the top of you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of entry to the sensors for example of the pressure sensors and the reef sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack with false data.
And believe it or not, this false data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant -- when the big steam turbines is about speed, you have to open the escape.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator,
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And neither the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could also work as well, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
They were doing as possible.
And if you made that, you know, with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We need to deal with the consequences and better than we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you <unk> abilities or another thing that makes users from your wheels and raise them back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They are not different from something that gets into the morning, gives you one great force -- that you can also increase your speed, and help you for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and other magnificent things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier that, on average, it must take on their back a <unk> load of <unk> and it's getting a lot more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic harm <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton can be <unk> 90 pounds of land for many hours.
His flexible design allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and running <unk> movement.
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of a <unk> about what I'm particularly passionate passionate about.
There are 68 million people who are on the <unk> in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage in the spinal cord than when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that <unk> the <unk>
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- it's the wheelchair.
And this has been like this for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19, he had a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and the knees, and they make it forward with this very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, skiing down <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> movement.
Little time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So he stole my last little bit of hope for me to be.
The technology of adapting since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs to <unk> it costs the rocks and even ride a bike <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology to sit down and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just by soldiers, but to Amanda, and all of the users of the <unk> of <unk> everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just went back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know their cousins.
This is the world of wild Bonobos in the rainforests of the Congo.
<unk> are along with chimpanzees, their living lives more <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> the Bonobo Bonobo is in charge of female power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario from a violent conflict that has been done for decades and caused almost so many deaths like the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> hunting and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the Bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden by hiding the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity -- given that the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the roots of the laughter -- same of the laughter, the dance and the human flight.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "It has <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves her, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is a young female female, which is playing with a little young water.
I think, as it -- sometimes we play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it is that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we have is the real <unk> of creativity.
These are only little samples of understanding the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we need to adapt to a more difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> at the most of our capacity of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For humankind, the life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, they can be the moments in which it's the most urgent time.
So fellow primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and play together as you think of creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a fire department for volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers are attributed to a highly skilled staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our job was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first up to the captain and he was asked to get up and would save the dog from the owner
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I walked into a building in a call to save a live being just because he made me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go to the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and it brings to this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire department -- that at that height of that height or less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
And I took my payload on the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> of the house I treasures for the owner of house where, as he was expected, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of the <unk> <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at over the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling on my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling to volunteer -- I'm witnessing acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made, or they're doing remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park in the neighborhood.
Are you mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to influence somebody's life.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, he comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, <unk> of a fixed extent that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things that we, as buildings or bridges or bridges at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He was called, <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 million bricks in the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> world of <unk> piled on a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the square block of concrete, the transistor allows to create much greater circuits and more complex and a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know it -- that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists, and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together through magnets together.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the go, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits,
A blue one is that they make light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, then it's here, and now we have a light module
And we got this <unk> to create more impact and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or slower or more slow, just this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing up.
We want all of the interactions in the world to <unk> to <unk> to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We have given the children to see them to see them playing with them.
And it's been an amazing experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light from night, or why does the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago we took the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, only in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done a project that have been done, a fishing cannon <unk>
But hang on, here comes my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach for everyone.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So I'm going forward and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is seeking to engage with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a few Peace <unk> to <unk>
I took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to Third World we send them to the wildlife <unk>
They made great <unk> they worked with employees <unk>
Their job is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I could find a quote, but what you really search for is that somebody has to clean it when you have caught up with the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment I was spending a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members of members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that the citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
Do you accept <unk> when you <unk>
So when you do that, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a psychological component of it.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications, <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government is <unk>
And it spread into viral ways.
One responsible for <unk> City systems to see this app realized that he could use it, not to snow, but for citizens to have <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people get <unk>
That's why he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to get people to stop to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that we will use use it.
And this has spread without <unk> organic and nature.
If you know a little bit about government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they have done by normal channels would have taken at least two and part of two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the court court that until the moment has two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot shot from the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like in private companies as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of dealing with the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are really good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications that are <unk> every day in their own communities.
They have not given the government.
Do you feel a great frustration before that, but you don't have it <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we left the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they give us crazy, the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> which we do together because not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The policy doesn't <unk> the government itself.
And since the government ultimately passed away from -- you remember that <unk> the way it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years, I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you have a <unk> brand in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates out of the house, put it very hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone, called <unk> <unk>
They don't <unk> that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this happened really, is this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and physical physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government of the government to voluntary collaboration as well.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology to platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key <unk>
I connected the two people.
And I could get it connected to the governmental services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we will go to the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will save our values and fix our needs but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface surface <unk>
That's why we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which is keeping us from that that we financed as something that financed as something that operates on our behavior, that one thing, and as a result, we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make the bureaucracy that is sexy.
Because it's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've got them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us who have been aware of the government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave with our kids.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do without a government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the government function so that it can be able to expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> only you have to articulate systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their views in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they cope with the government problem, they don't care about making your voices.
They are using their hands.
They lay hands into the work to program applications that make a better function to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out of it, put them a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to get cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone there, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we all have a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and death row.
I've spent most of my life in community communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED, looking at these stimulus -- has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of them in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way they saw the world.
She was a <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me, and he said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I would tell me again and if I said I know, I left it in peace.
He had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the top of 10.
Occasionally when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at it, and he was like, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up and went through the room, and he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on, we both go to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's get it.
She said, "Now <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what they <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just do I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What first I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always be the right thing though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
Then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that we never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field in rural <unk> I have a brother a year and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just got to do the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You know, you know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good -- you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I went in a <unk> look at the strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of her grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My cough died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, we had to <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on the parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, they find so much <unk> so despair, determined by these facts.
One of every three black men between 18 and 30 years is in prison, or the freedom parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Philadelphia, UMBC, from 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in prison or freedom.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth is the wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear politics and the anger of fear is making us believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
I find myself interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious developments at work.
In my state in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rid of the rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected the next 10 years the level of loss of rights is going to be as high as it was before they had the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent kids.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where he was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance of getting out.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, we have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by <unk> crimes but we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty death is defined by mistake.
In every nine people who has been identified that it's innocent that it's innocent and released from the death row of death.
A rate of mistake, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed by being able to fly airplanes if every single nine ones that <unk> you would have from <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue that we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I talk about slavery in the story.
I talk to you about terror, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat terror was what he defined his lives.
Now there are older people coming up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you say talks, makes <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own deal with the first time with terrorism after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all of the time we're going to share with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
We have work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
And in South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> and without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's okay to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> we don't have a death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to take it here."
The room stood in silence and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, and intentional and <unk> we set up to <unk>
So let's get rid of this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't get it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both of these things.
We talk about the need to have more hope, greater commitment, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational, so committed to intellectual <unk>
With innovation, with creativity -- development comes from not just the brain ideas.
These things come from ideas come from ideas that come from the convictions of the heart.
This connection to the heart is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, I was suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for spirit, a will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There is no disconnect to related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to the <unk> to the inequality, to the injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege -- being a young lawyer, to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together, just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I was called to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get to speak.
Do you want to come and get it.
I would say, "Yes, I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, thank you to tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty thing.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that moment, Ms. <unk> <unk> he got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by law.
I also think in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> so <unk> not to judge us for our technology, by our designs, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of it <unk> the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich and powerful and <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison, and I see my customers at 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge make someone in what is not it?
The judge was an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late I was awake with God, if the judge can become something that you don't have, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think of correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a little, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a privileged <unk> <unk> executive in a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been some <unk> behavior in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it, but he had sent it to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly feeling <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car, I walked out to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man -- it was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached myself and <unk> me.
And I stood up in our ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected to my interior, with my identity with the capacity that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
He said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> and we started argue.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops -- the prosecutors <unk> <unk> <unk>
And suddenly without knowing how, the room was filled with people -- because we were talking about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I went back to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I looked through the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
Finally, this old black man, with a head of worry, walked in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> showed me upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant <unk> over old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black hole stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young woman who keeps her sight in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up towards justice.
That we can't really be able to be able to be <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be attached to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, those of us who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the sight of the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, in this community, to help you do something.
Something that's not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there's going to be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to be an effort to fund the funds that are spent today in political policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the last five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes do not get nowhere.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these money to get the law to <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think is it?
<unk> The rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to a chain to lead to a <unk> a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing do for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> You've got us excited today here.
You are very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats by death of Bin Laden.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds will pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses, our senses are getting more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And like nothing we care more than survive, the first stop of all of these data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector <unk>
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the negative ones.
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices will give us a negative news on the week, 24 days a week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world goes wrong with worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good issues, climate change, the extinction of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we just had them.
<unk> then that happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita per capita adjusted by inflation has <unk> all over the world.
The child mortality has been reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food from the electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people would have it.
And we keep getting higher expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, we would get the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So we have a lot of this technology -- and then it has exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in a <unk> and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop against any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, <unk> goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends from <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet -- synthetic biology, fuels and digital, <unk> and digital medicine and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and digital, <unk> and
I mean, how many of you saw victory on "Jeopardy" from Watson, of <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking for the newspapers the best headline that I was doing.
And I loved this.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about to take that that's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story about Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate with covered in silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate covered with aluminum <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington tip of aluminum.
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> and it made the aluminum that we use it as it was <unk>
So let's get this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about entertainment, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT ran a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous photograph, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, that two percent is ice, and we fought the <unk> of the planet, but also there is a hope.
It's a technology that is available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> the size of a small refrigerator size.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any source -- saltwater, saltwater, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just reminded me that I will make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in that way, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan ago 25 years ago.
And having a smart cell with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever seen.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> images, images of diagnostic books and music <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to it when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we were challenging these technologies in a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> they can <unk> you can get your blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a <unk> team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
So when this device is <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that I don't want to call the health care and the first place, to prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increase.
The white lines here are the population.
We just had a <unk> mark on seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> the global conversation.
What will these people?
What <unk> What desires.
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> from more health, thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D and the computer in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion members of the human humankind, healthy polite and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
How about if we give the defenseless, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time?
What did these three <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small, guided by his passion with an objective of of course, can do things that were going to be able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of us already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and began to <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to get us to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for some remarkable decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I would give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, like you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they're still <unk>
So what's going on here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could do it.
I burned very much with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of some <unk>
I had <unk> from about 20 feet -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishing fishery was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than a half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined in half.
It would be on five inches.
They would give a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developmental projects.
<unk> development was imposing to the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the Industrial
And this boat, pretty ugly, it was called, <unk>
I went out to fish in it, and we ran in the south of the Sea China <unk> and mostly on the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are the small blobs on a few <unk> remains that are fish of coral reefs.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead.
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a living one.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect fishermen every time you go to one area that they never have fish.
But there's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
<unk> the starting point -- the new level, without remembering what was there.
So if you will, this happens something like this.
On the axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. Changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the kind of a changes.
And then you keep a few <unk> <unk>
And that, in great measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer anymore, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose small animals.
If this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a very large sea of big fish.
They become somewhat frequent because the <unk>
Over time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a way before it is not the way they would expect it to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like a captain like a captain like a captain of a lot of fish in this area cannot be used, or usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that can be a protected marine area.
Because with marine areas, we actually visualize the past.
You know, the past people cannot conceive of it, because the starting point has been over.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema might be able to fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved to the film that they were going to talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to giving, is to Cameron -- to do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are made and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But now the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper into a part of our global culture.
Anybody can do a famous thing on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of the percentage is getting lots and lots and lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: <unk> communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the <unk> in the rise of popularity last summer.
I was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this story to <unk> the video to <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new things and interesting and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on a Friday.   Everyone wants you to get in the end of a week, the weekend.                                      I won't think we could
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of creators will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this great joke inside of it, then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment difference in the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know there's a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did one version of the old version.
And then it was international then.
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> which made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form there.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted a <unk> or <unk> or Black Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script could you have was written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video is going on, just the only one and unexpected thing can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who will protest the <unk> to <unk> in New York, I'm not interested in too much.
They were <unk> by the <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that can be transported properly by <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey Casey managed to get five million you saw and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new thing that we do <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question of question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of <unk> creative communities -- completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the very popular.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrity <unk> Justin started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a bit masters of our pop culture.
These are not the features of the old media -- they're just the ones of today's means -- but <unk> entertainment in the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
So the words, for so long, friends, now do it.
They lie in the silence.
He died broken through the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget her story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I did it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat sits down to the sea pool of ship <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The highest fear was the supply and rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing an poison.
If we first got to it, we would take away my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My earliest memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember the hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and he died, and he died, and he was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried to have been given by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp -- <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of capital?
Unlike the <unk> <unk> whose existence I <unk> in <unk> had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English in the middle of the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a <unk> assembly line, working six days, two days turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get an title in IT <unk> from the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they put an extra tutoring in English and mathematics, they wouldn't matter what it was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> clothing.
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there were <unk> <unk> and <unk> on <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back home.
I'm home, where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the motions of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares in order to get <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were going to come with their stories about men who couldn't do the angry and <unk> and <unk> boys and <unk> trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
They created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was a <unk> classical student -- relentless with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of Law, they chose the old Australian man in the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges, not <unk>
So <unk> resident anonymously from <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and activist activist invited to talk about sites that had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the location of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
<unk> had never been an option.
He said, "What do you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and <unk>
And the more I was talking, the longer I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were going to live, living in the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a newly <unk> new one in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside of my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a power there, an <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would give you a little group of people for the <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant bomb pot that all <unk>
They went down to the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure.
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to <unk> and lead the cause she did, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't have done it being <unk>
I was in the shower in a hotel room when she died, he died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is her hand hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"You haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Since we were and how life we were built, we can now see that the men that have come to our lives would have been <unk>
<unk> had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could do that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy to the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, diving into brave in every wave, the natural <unk> of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could get it to you and see them a lot, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother is now here, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car, to go to the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I <unk> the great prince of Prince Indian warrior -- he was <unk> he threw a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, he picks up water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of fun with me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not to <unk>
As a girl, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this kind of technology for 50 years was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out.
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I was threw into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how to take the book, you know.
Where we are.
They collect the text with the image, animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is a <unk> I write my name.
And so I was a character of the book.
In a few moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes through me.
My little girl are excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, these ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me exciting.
So over here, we need to shift the iPad to liberate fireflies.
And actually, they light your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy was a <unk>
So here, every book and every book is turned into a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all the fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and you guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another critical aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary content.
These here are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old old <unk>
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual we have to go out and in one chapter, a picture of a flower to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is created a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
So within the variants of connection between the magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we got to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through through augmented reality it sees a group of cartoons that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment the screen is filled with leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world in which the forces of nature are going on, with technology and magic and technology come to each other.
<unk> the power of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or asked patients, family and asked patients, what would you do?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all of the projects, but most of the projects of the projects, they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi. It's a very simple thing.
It has a ticket, and it has closed off.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I was sending me sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same moment when it needs <unk> or some urgency of that style, but it would see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 10,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you climb up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can do it to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the week next to be available on the week will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to go from their homes, take their blood pressure, send them to their doctor, and share with each other for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, back to recover control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things that we would like to share with you with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls, the <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where machines are in <unk>
Where are they all <unk>
And of course, we can find chains of fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one would happen.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience, you see a <unk> please look at <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in the office <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone -- to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we would want to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of the <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on holiday and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us build these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please forgive me in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, these are photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I teamed up with my <unk> passion but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me photography I had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start with the press <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected twist
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to be captured in some way as photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem true.
They are the details or the <unk>
We cut light?
What do you create <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of this is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way can create something that still looks like <unk> as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take your brain because the brain doesn't follow the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process as we combine the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic -- I think they're those where you don't even know the things around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine these pictures is very important, because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> you must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect person.
It has to be impossible to see where the image would be.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the personal one, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured by a stone.
And yes, I even made red from the top of the top of the island to find more <unk>
So to achieve a realistic result I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took out of a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing the details -- but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other that we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk> scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light up the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we create technology <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if I draw into a normal curve, in which, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to do -- the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you think about for example, some other technology, like transport, in a <unk> curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if you happen something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation will be as fast as <unk> tomorrow tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is unprecedented in the history of technological development -- that every few years enormous orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these curves -- we see that they don't have forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
So let's get one of two things.
Or it will be turned into a typical curve like this until it comes up to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
This line is in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and I ask myself, is: what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So we go back to a couple and a half billion years ago when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that went around them.
If you look at the way that those chemicals organized we give us a sense of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there was some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes on its inside.
Some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals that made them put out of the outside of the outside and so the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms that these oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time it gets <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to bring those chemicals into the <unk> <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life chemistry, very simple -- but things became interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemist called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without any sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved since evolving two billion years ago.
Our recipe -- our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same <unk> system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> we can actually write things with this code.
Here's 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the safety of the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would be <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for each person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and it would have spread to the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells were happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things became very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information and communicate information that cells like cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and <unk> a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or it was that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community became more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up so much that they actually came together, and they decided to write all the recipe in the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't have no heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that were not making more to process information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> understanding and conveying information.
Those were brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learn to not eat a certain fruit because he knew the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit on that game.
So the fact that the nervous system built those information structures really accelerated to the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to one individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here sitting emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated and we converted it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
Now we went through periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our methods of <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer -- the <unk> the video tape, the <unk> and so and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in jeans.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where he produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
Next to it, the language etc., they took less than a million years.
And beyond, as the electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that causes its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster you do.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that we work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent machines.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk> <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that you didn't do -- it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the origins.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of <unk>
You could run these sequences of <unk> <unk> running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to explain numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 of those random sequences that are best made by <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now we need the ones that better deal with the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog <unk> to the <unk>
Let's take two programs -- that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the children are going to take the properties of these two programs.
So we get a new generation of programs from the <unk> programs that they had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
They have some mutations going on.
And he tries to get it back and get it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that were absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are red programs.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage lineage of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> he has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that are there.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing goes every faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment of analog organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part of thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of creating whatever it is that it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I got up.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> the <unk> talks about statistics and used to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about 300 of a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game of play without being <unk> and that anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base -- not get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know how to call a <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody than 10 <unk> I get four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> on a regular season on a regular season.
Now I think of this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I will tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and it's a surgeon who has a surgeon who has a 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place, and a dear person has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family physician runs through a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a remarkably profound year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think should be the average hits of a heart surgeon, or a <unk> or a nurse or a <unk>
All right.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or <unk>
What we do, however, is sending me the world, and I include the <unk> of being perfect.
And I'd never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a student called <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman Sachs was a <unk>
Such nice.
<unk> in my little <unk> in my <unk> nurses in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> whale diagnosis and the <unk> <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of the school school with the impression that if you will, everything, then would you know everything, or as much as possible, it would close to all of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency service, where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied a meeting to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And they will report to the chief of the residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides -- which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> of blood, and that's why there's a difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I read him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
I actually made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, it would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that will be <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even contact to my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, it was so not not that he was so sure that he asked the nurse that he would join the lady <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> he said, "Yes, I think being okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high and the ambulance with the ambulance who took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that evening, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I kept with my job.
At the end of the day, I went down to leave the hospital and truck to the parking lot where my car was to go home. So I did something that I don't normally ask.
I went through the emergency service service.
And there is another nurse, not that I was born from the lady <unk> before, but another one -- he told me three words, those three words that most <unk>
Other people are afraid of them as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same kind of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By one time he had come to his house, after I was given to him, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance and the ambulance who brought them to the emergency pressure of <unk> <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I was just breathing and she was blue.
<unk> personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise the blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all of the hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
He had a <unk> brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, he was going to get to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he left her to go. The lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks I was reminded of it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford your colleagues.
You make peace and make it more made that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad at it.
It tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure that I was doing things and made sure that I didn't care about.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little at a little bit that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I was wondering if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was able to deal with the efforts to be perfect to be a perfect to make more mistakes, I would do whatever that voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, I was teaching in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got to a man who was 25 years of pain.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at his throat, I was a little <unk>
He took him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door followed his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my head <unk> my chief asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and he didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition.
You can Google at Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He didn't die.
You would pay antibiotics for it <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
I had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient -- and he was able to sort of sensitivity on the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it up and when you see a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner called the surgeon called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered they recovered they recovered too.
But every case I got to love me with you.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how could I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for not the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you listened to someone to talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, I knew that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> who make mistakes, and the ones that they can't sleep, and the ones that they can't sleep, and the ones that have <unk> results and the ones who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you move from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of about diffusion and journalism, I've done a bad personal study of bad medical <unk> to learn how we can, from the first article that I wrote to you for Star article to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one of every 10 drugs that are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system in which bacterial infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 3,000 Canadian <unk> for errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we are not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is going to take up every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in your chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and I breathe with alcohol and all of a sudden my story gets away from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we get to us, and we remove all the professionals as likely to error, well, not going to get anybody.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white, <unk> art, it's already a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> -- I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of <unk> surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> to go down your head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we could do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The Swedish doctor is human <unk> you know human, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the mistakes of other people, but in a loving way, and support and support for everybody else.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human. I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot, but I have to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
Recently, I made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to choose an American American, it's about 70 a day.
Not a lot, in a research followed for a week to a group of presidents for business.
The researchers at the same set of the different <unk> tasks of these executives and time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every job had a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their election.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you find the way that they deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choosing the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
In another way, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some 25 of the water <unk> and this was when you were able to get water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I had one occasion, why I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf in the <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> box that were coming from <unk> trees.
One time I decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out to me the buses filled with tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
lobby.
They had <unk> different classes.
They put a place for <unk> right at the entrance to the store.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors and different flavors and looked at two things: First, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent, when there were only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Where they stopped when I had <unk> only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
If there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six, that if they were six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we're probably going to get <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices are affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds were available in savings plans.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans for two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge funds had less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans they offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you have more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater one was the number of choices, more people being used to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in market bank accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
What is most likely to do is we <unk> the decision that the <unk> even when this is going on against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the world's worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick up something less likely to pick up things, even though they're objectively better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at this giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to contrast and choose from that stunning <unk>
Today I want to talk about four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always annoyed when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of strange <unk> options, there's going to be an increase on sales, the costs will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for hydrogen and less <unk> they were raised in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and less costs.
You know the supermarkets of today, on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, they have about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato sauce.
In the financial survival, I think one of the best examples that have sprung up about how to handle the choices is <unk> by David <unk> the Harvard program.
All employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically to a standard of life.
People who are really willing to choose, they have 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all options that are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This evening, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience to a holiday with all of paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In reality, you had more information in the first turn, than in the second, but I can tell you that they thought that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of measuring choices that is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and the consequences must feel very <unk>
Why are people spend 15 percent more on average, when you use credit cards or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were working on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting exactly how we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
So what we added was to give the staff to the staff who would think about the positive things that they would get in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of 20 percent increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place on their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
We saw that in the supermarkets -- <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This <unk> scheme is totally useless.
categories must tell you something that they are going to be, not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
I'm supposed to know who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can drive a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase the exponential complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a very good decision on the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to take a <unk> to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
It was 56 color in the car.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order where the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, to a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choice, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?"
How much you are.
If you have a <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that those who are going from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of changes that does not say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> to eliminate alternative alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices will be able to practice <unk>
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write it must be used to the government.
You had to record a text of example written with the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of texts.
If they had a written written with the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this would be, the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and print one page, that page is going to end up having a few little red <unk> on every page that makes a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the web.
If you look at what happens in the online world, we can put up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to win a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer computer.
The U.S. secret service ago, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss realize of this sir, Sam <unk> and this tells a <unk> million dollars when he was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> It's <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, who motivate the protests, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a big role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that they do to protest and the last group are the U.S. national <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> in the Netherlands or actually it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
I took the safety of the website, and I took a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with government representatives who asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do we <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services -- services like <unk>
Except that we would have a foreign <unk> authority.
And they were releasing <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters -- the headquarters for the Egyptian secret police police in 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were some notes of a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government, the tools to intercept the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 billion euros to the <unk> government.
The headquarters for the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments, provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing it themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully at things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks like something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have to be in today, will be forever.
<unk> in any future government, in a administration that we might have in 50 years?
These are the questions that must be concerned about in the next 50 years.
Here's where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences in the largest part of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like lions lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and find it dead in the morning and found it dead because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
People are dying of warriors that protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the Yellowstone National Park.
A child in my community, in the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of their father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid of them.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen from a way.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart -- they came to the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come out.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that is moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that I'll turn out and shut up the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks up the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give up the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got to have trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses had heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
He had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it in the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've set up in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by all Kenya, to freak other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant from the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise money and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the grasslands, of the <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying fighters and he told me that one day would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come on to TED.
My big dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and a pilot when I grew up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: Are you working on other electric inventions in it.
What's the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of electric power.
<unk> I know you were already invented.
CA: You know, I think of it once, right, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I got a couple of them because I got a <unk>  CA: Al <unk> Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to go to <unk> in every step that I would have to get to my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are enemies.
Although I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public work.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my colleague of my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> that five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks in the time.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're ready to die."
I was very grateful.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little while, when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a little kid in his arms looking at her face of her mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine transferred to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during starvation and only they survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a red picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which serves <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw the bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I'd never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee camps.
But it suddenly learned that it's not just hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees North North China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> by the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I was <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to blow up.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake page. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there was eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
I was fortunate to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of the world can be done in a second.
That's why, after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to be going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I had expected.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was a country that I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, made a plan. I started studying the exam of college to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North North North Korea is a little bit of money that sent my family, and as blame, my family was going to be shifted to force to a location from the way in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
The North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to do it in a way, for over 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked all of you and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but luckily I believed me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did all of us to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance of the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go between the office of immigration and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man wondering, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care about asking him.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I gave him the situation, and without the <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and to get them out of prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping to be helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get the <unk>
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people who are needed.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family contact, and we send information and money that are helping to change North Korea.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North America, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> shops of <unk> fast food, <unk>
So the city planners came together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South the South order to represent something else, so they changed the Los Angeles -- as if this is actually going to be wrong in the city.
This is the South L.A.  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home from the food places to get and eat in the car.
What's curious about it is that the food places to get kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from home you see the effects of the current food system that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of wheels <unk> and sold as cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 by 45 meters by three.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to be able to go.
I said, "Well, I can do what me is to come in win because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to be able to go.
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine different vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of group paid by shifting by gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came up to me and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> was made by <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A criminal order for plant food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's get it.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plant plants.
Why the hell doesn't it look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
And I grew up there. It would take my children there.
I was amazed to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
As an artist <unk> that <unk> walls, I was <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk>
They were trying to see what earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I'm a witness to how my garden became an education tool, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the ground.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most controversial act and provocative act in a <unk>
In addition, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> at night and they were in my garden. And they looked very <unk>
Me, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by seeing people who were so close to me with hungry, and this only reinforces the reason why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people will steal your <unk>
So I say, "My God, I don't have to fear that you will go to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to raise your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, and they shared her stories about how this had been affected by how this was affected by and how they used to plant with their mom and their grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed as just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people coming from, and they work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> you will eat <unk>  But if none of you are going to tell you, if you're not taught how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind in front of what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're caught. I see color of color that are on this way designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you create the next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take container and convert them in healthy <unk>
I didn't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free, it's not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try to work to people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, by opening by farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You know, the <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they don't call me if you want to sit on a comfortable chairs. And having meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road at all.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that you <unk>
And especially if you go on this bike, and these cars go forward, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands -- very close to the cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution to that is making roads of asphalt <unk>
Next asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and the water can happen through it, so all water water will flow into the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't have a road that is easy to drive water.
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's too <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you can see that on this road the stones are over.
They first got a stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and you say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more resistant.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage to this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so there's only a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> they're going to get <unk> and get away from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials from <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel and steel <unk> and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of <unk> steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at it.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and rocks go back to the surface.
I used a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to the stage.
<unk> oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, that now I'm going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting.
So we donated a little bit of a road, 400 feet of the highway <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did in there. Do you see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any harm.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the ones then with our <unk> machine, and we got them back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using fiber of steel, incorporating them together using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the surface of the road, you can even save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this works.
We still have the sample here. It's quite hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts to you.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was hearing BBC News in his little gray.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is usually <unk>
"The Taliban got my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban ran out of Afghanistan and they did illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could be able to do it.
Every day, we would take a different route so that nobody could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in market bag, so they seem to hide shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us got in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And once in a week, school was married for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and girls a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, my mother, to go to school and so his father would get it.
But my educated <unk> became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first one of his family to receive education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate his kids.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and I was always scared and not to see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you don't want to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the middle school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not only <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman who I carry him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what we <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the friend, <unk> for them, even though they were even in front of a single opposition game.
<unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally, they were <unk> of being killed by a pump on the way, for minutes.
When I got to her home, they are the phone, a voice <unk> him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would return to a try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've figured out from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school with <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes would not last a lot, after the retirement of American troops <unk>
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never return to a revolutionary style of <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the wave of massive <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a courage to face the <unk> dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of a six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we were able to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with a lot of other women, <unk> civil society -- <unk> the political transition and just towards democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded the <unk> of women -- <unk> by <unk> a women's movement of women, leaders, very <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> that are made of the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election for 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> old mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the top of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder officers of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their inhibited the human rights violations.
Our society, made up a revolutionary mentality -- it becomes more than the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose badly, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination, and so much for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only the women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election, that just <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the ultimate representation of the female to need the most likely to need to be <unk> and we used it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, that not only <unk> but also put the mercy in practice instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competence, inclusion instead of competence, inclusion in place.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, needs desperately to be able to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known to all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic, that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that embraces all the humanity that men and women, that all the tribes and all the tribes have been <unk>
And so like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- <unk> all of our existence.
So you say, "My mercy is propagating all the things."
This is how it tells us, "My mercy is going to tell you about my <unk>
That everyone else gets rid of the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a <unk> question, which is a equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is that they all make a very long question: Why is it left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who gave him <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old, I had just been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and he had a very big secret.
And my secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul -- <unk> me on my head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets of <unk>
The man, which I loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap. <unk> of love, where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I am about 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, every religion, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and said in the families, the last place that we would want or expect to find out to be <unk> because of which domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that I was going to sit with a man who does her, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold <unk> the night of January.
I was sitting next to my New York subway in New York City and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a college of <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a <unk>
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> and <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- that I was ready -- that he had been at Harvard, that I was passionate about helping girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> I believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done before.
And I was so that the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and her future is so important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I was coming out of New York City and leaving my work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I thought, I quit my job and <unk> and I went back to Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling down in a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a physical <unk> financial <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where you go into the scene of those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to do, I had to feel so safe to be bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another put it under the pillow in our bed and third always in their pocket.
And he said he needed those guns because of trauma that lived smaller.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted up my hand, my life was still <unk> every minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend suit and married him with him.
Despite what had occurred, I was sure that we lived happily forever, because I loved him and he was also wanted to be a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had felt very <unk> by the wedding and by the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and it was never more to me.
I spent twice as well in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that he <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our head, of honey and spread through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk> to the face.
<unk> followed a day or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or cookies.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that I could help join their <unk>
The other question everyone else does is, why don't you just don't <unk>
Why didn't you get? I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do people, because we are the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has late to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend their mother.
And yet we keep wondering why it's simply not <unk>
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed me if there was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the world to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, all of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are going to tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like headlines like <unk> women -- women who are <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you do?"
For some people it's a way to say, <unk> is yours by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to be <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women that also <unk> that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to us, and they will save their lives joyful and happy lives as <unk> wives and mothers, life completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to <unk> with a cute man and kind of kind of kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to do to have never even more -- ever is a <unk> gun to my head in the hands of someone who says he wants me.
At this moment, it's just thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they are being <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting her daughter, to her sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence, just throwing light on it.
The victims need to all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their fellow jobs, their friends and family.
<unk> your vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the inner signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe way.
Together, we can turn our bed, our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years.
And I feel that right now, there's a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first job of clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of luck -- I think.
If some of the women would be excited when they <unk> you don't have to do it now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These classrooms, are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater by your head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything when I covers your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this photo, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to get my back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial figure that I made two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our senses, which, even though even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always said, <unk> <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I became model is because I won the genetic lottery -- and I'm the <unk> of an heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically hardwired for <unk> also we've associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage future that I've known to exploit to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown now -- and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion <unk>
First of all, the <unk> by knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- <unk> <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I didn't care about that.
But then what I would really tell you about each of these girls is, why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or the <unk> and <unk> surgeon and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, we still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> American magazine or the CEO executive CEO or the next Steven <unk>
Saying you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've seen your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to do, I mean, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you copy your <unk> <unk> for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always do is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, pretty much all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I took my grandmother to a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a party of <unk> a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do to me is to take things for free?
I have too many <unk> 20 inches and never use, except the very few -- but the privilege I get to get out are the ones I get in real life, and we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a grocery store, and I forgot to take the money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> a red light was formed in red and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> -- an agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because of my senses, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who were couple and 86 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of me.
It was how many times I am, and <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I found out that 53 percent of 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question people ask me is: How do you have a life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and I'm beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, you get some more thin legs and the brightest hair will be more happy?
You just have to meet a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brightest hair and the <unk> clothes, but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation for racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have from success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you today my 15 pictures <unk> and I didn't know who the <unk>
There were no <unk> <unk> or <unk> and a chance to repeat the photos, not even a very small <unk> on lighting.
In fact, most of them pulled them tourists at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give me a <unk> my wife got me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He gave the chance we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to get the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you get <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to be able to get out of it.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never ever been denied and, fortunately, never nobody has ever met.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change us.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is from a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a five years -- I could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time in October week and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter has a new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it feels and it interacts with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
So recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly, it was stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls store, which <unk> in previous <unk>
And it described me what it was about five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that reminded the heart of their heart will be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in a lot of family pictures.
I'm always the one that gets the picture.
I want to encourage everyone to appear in the photo, and I don't want to go into someone and asked, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughter, as a silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And they're far away from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.  There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> in the New World that are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the World War, where we have 16 species of extinction.
So, why are those important? First of all, they provide life ecological services.
They are our natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help killing all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax of <unk> that they would not be able to spread great loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and the bottom <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing a lot of important <unk> to open <unk> and in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in the very extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> -- the <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> and the critical list, of extinction, <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey from the <unk> consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned by veterinary use in India, and they've taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of times of anger has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above the lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines are doing this to birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so we will focus on a global problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you leave this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it <unk> without the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, <unk> Coast <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Rather than that, all of the things that we were going to do?
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people in Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, because of what they were going to do to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have a <unk>  We were wondering that the local in so fertile -- they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were not <unk> anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> In Italy, a toxic tomato guy in Italy, to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them to <unk> "Look how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said it all --  and we said to them, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you have agriculture <unk>
I thought we just did Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what they were doing, what the characters were doing, and then seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people of Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors, we've delivered to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners is <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture like my children, "Do you want a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if I were my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This is supposed to be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided at 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start any of all, you will never engage somebody, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
It never gets to a community with an idea, and he sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a cafe. We sat down in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give one idea to anyone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in meetings with them.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with meetings with the communities.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have to <unk>
So, planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they didn't go into their public meetings.
What do we do? We work on one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician from the company, the family physician in the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of your house, at the table of his kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was making a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this crap condescending in which we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see me and ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
I was <unk> and ...  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business fighters passed back to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a research professor before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
planning is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to talk to you.
You have to give you a <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they have to be great in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to show you about this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- we may not renewable renewable <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of sustaining <unk> it's not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> we can communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a nice story that I read in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't have been in 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is keeping up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> --  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- factories in places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise they won't have to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell it has to be fantastic, you have to have to have a fantastic marketing -- you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell to the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 companies icons of the world -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one starts a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated contribution to who will do for you, what someone made by this gentleman is talking about this <unk> someone who talks to you, what should they need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You know, I would find you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't make a lot of knowledge by spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects arose like, how much my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild wilderness of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It turns out to accommodate music.  there's a <unk> in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most many abandoned properties of the U.S.
I live close to this house and I thought how could it turn it into a better space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and he was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death, and I thought a lot.
And this led to me a profound gratitude for time and the time of time.
It gave the clarity to the significant things in my current life.
But let me just keep this look in my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board, and he painted on her sentences for <unk> "Before to die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and sharing personal aspiration in the public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they died, I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I died, I want to give you a more."
Before I died, I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
Before they died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope for people to laugh at me laughing <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's trying to understand our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in civic center, we made a kit, and now they've been made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions growing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective, and remember that life is brief and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are going to be more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us, cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my brothers.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's very hot.
No speech, but transmits joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
<unk> shares what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and note on this: never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even be able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing -- the little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that she came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, you'd pee in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like amazing?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't adjust to the notion of normal society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case -- although you don't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> <unk>
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain complex that affects social communication, to learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there, which is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of development that faster increases in the world, there's no cause no cause or <unk>
I don't agree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new one in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, it didn't seem really very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything there was <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a kid who saw the world without biases, a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normality.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in their inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change in the moment in which we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been to be <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, to give a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds and their great books and <unk> words.
But the way that those conversations, I felt like that <unk> must have felt sense when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I had those conversations with the students. They surprised me the ideas that they had, and I wanted other to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the environment and health care of health care, between others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't just tell us that they study the <unk> but they study <unk> which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> it's not the same thing that I make a stupid <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are in ways of turning them down and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been wondering why they call <unk>  What do you do? bullets are killed kill, and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain, and we are <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only one of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give the graphs that we will engage in our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just a few key ones that can help each other open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've got this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford in Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that he defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge no matter or platform, and that, when he <unk> you get it by mere use of monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the unlikely name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They put her in the Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that they might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And they were not even <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected by King for a given time.
And there might be <unk>
All the world got tired and <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House were against the <unk>
The House House didn't want Washington to become power.
They would not want to call it King because she would give him to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. You had just existed before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate <unk>
They said, "Well we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to be treated and <unk> with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to be serious with a <unk> and <unk> title as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to follow there, hoping that the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that as a government is <unk>  <unk> you might keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important, and I want to warn you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear <unk> the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have been endowed with the headline of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
All because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to be humble when you tell them that it's the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really changes the words -- much more the words than that could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to a meter under land in an illegal <unk> mine.
The air is <unk> of heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the darkness, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that are talking about but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> male and stones are shown with primitive.
Like each other, I carry a cheap <unk> of light -- he held her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold up the walls of that foot of a meter which falls hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met a little days earlier, who lost control and got countless feet in that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in deep from that hole at the risk of their lives without pays for no rewards and often, they die.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents and 2009, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only person in the Peace <unk>
Among all the incredible people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is involved in <unk> modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not as a grade.
When we finished talking to me very sad, I was honestly -- to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He got me up and his stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, there was a lot of these sites.
Some of you even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the number of Africans displaced for all of the slaves to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary from a U.S. worker.
That's the equivalent of a <unk> 50,000 today.
However, today, you can pay family families for generations by <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits for over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pays under violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost all over the world, and yet, it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable was how to go into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women -- in fact, whole families -- <unk> families in a heavy <unk> of <unk> packaged and bricks and bricks and <unk> and the <unk> <unk> trucks that are hundreds of feet to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch it, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work on air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my very quickly, and he grabbed me and said, <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship that happened.
I could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to rely on the <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for her liberation and trusted that he would do it.
As soon as me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children hauling stones for <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children who had charge and children were holding them on their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
It took me on a little bit of stairs <unk> which gave this basement dirty <unk> <unk> light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local for forced prostitution to <unk>
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of so seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their customers.
From foot in <unk> I remember a <unk> fear of <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be caught up on that hell.
I only had a little bit of the stairs where I was born.
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, The New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were whole families in the drug of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> black hands are the father, and the <unk> of blue and the red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope to get out of this house one day and go to another place where we really paid our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children on Lake <unk> the largest <unk> lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their <unk> families and forced them to work <unk> a lot of these boats on the lake, despite not knowing how to swim.
This kid has eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I know that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of water falling away.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, and fear, they're thrown into the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and like all of life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> about the youngest slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working on one of the way from one another.
<unk> it cold and <unk>
And it would be able to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi <unk> in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi "All as possible.
Who would be because of someone who decided to make the difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow who was suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to get it through a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in one of course and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their back and, as they were looking at gold, they were <unk> in water <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in his own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have to be 90 feet and these people carry on top plastic bags that then will be transported to another area where they would be able to extract the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer and close to it, we see the other fortunate and children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be able to end up with this <unk> victim and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died his father he took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, he <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who force him to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so severe that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, you have tuberculosis and yet to that, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists as <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, the face of a remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll have witness to them and we'll make everything possible to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not in magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day to happen that I don't think about these so many beautiful people -- I think I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in who you can see, in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn into a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math applied and there's a peculiar problem for whom we <unk> we are like management management.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try and explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of human activities.
We get rid of the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the <unk> dancers --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demands a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component that well.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time, was a virtuous dancer dance.
Over the last few years has been progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it is frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement are not <unk> so they don't have <unk> and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, out of the clinical trials, they never do.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could do <unk>
You don't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to <unk> as a kind of conventional <unk> you see, in a certain sense, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration of string strings.
It shows someone healthy as it makes sounds when you speak -- Can we imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs, to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed.
And just like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time it takes a child to learn to speak.
Now, from sound, we can track the position of vocal chords as <unk> as the Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the plot of the bottom -- you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> weakness and <unk>
The discourse becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> Both of the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are <unk> well, but also the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're at a minimum cost and we all know what happens.
And when something takes a cost that <unk> it has massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic to try routine.
With high-speed monitoring we could get objective data.
We could make this massive <unk> for clinical trials for the first time, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a big scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
And so by giving the first steps today in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's disease.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call under price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I took all these samples of, say, 10,000 people -- you'll be able to say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What do you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion for the actual markers of disease.
TR: They have a accuracy accuracy at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to have a fantastic job -- has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile phone network, what we <unk> the project. We now have 99 percent of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We lie in the darkness, in rooms without windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin even more perfect, we do the impossible, and we will be able to focus on the press all the time but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little while later, an organization where I was voluntary -- <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people located in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers away inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the sludge and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons of tons and tons of fish in dead, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and we love it.
For weeks, the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places from villages around to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to get out absolutely what they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of the town.
It helped clean the <unk> bathrooms -- gigantic enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of the <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were carried out and I had the honor of that day to be able to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard that expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through myself my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some were still in the lab, I couldn't help you think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had been <unk> the face of the girl had been <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her itself, and that would be so tragic as I have the photo <unk>
Over the time of the time, they came up for some more kind of photos and they had more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we asked <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
One time we use our scanner to the <unk> in the temporal libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we have in <unk> is a different story, it depends on course of the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour of an hour. I could do a couple of weeks.
I could do a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using how guide areas whose color and detail had no destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures it would take up in fresh water, covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of that along with the time I continue to <unk> that was a major part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless I was clean, dry and <unk> by his <unk>
We had <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> of <unk>
It's very easy to hurt even more the photos already <unk>
As he once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us up these pictures was lucky as a relationship to the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but stopped when he realized that they would get them even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been been able to, we were able to put the images into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of her story with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photos in a fire department between the rubble of the rubble -- pretty far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues had it.
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to bridge the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside of the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their kids, not as small now, but their two children were in the school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find her whole family, and knowing that everybody had survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could find something that he could come back to look, something that I could remember from the past that would not have been marked by the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them were helped us to clean out more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them became the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us to bring to 90 families hundreds of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the <unk> for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would be able to do, but the first thing that we were looking for.
This is what the project was trying to restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone with the past.
When a picture like this, you give somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something else with something else to give to something, using your talent to something that are not some thin skin.
To finish I'd like to read this email -- I emailed him the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I was born, I couldn't help you think about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to a small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs off our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just one millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a
But now, 50 years later, we can go for a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion dollars a second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion into movement in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser laser, and I switch it up and put it up in a <unk> second or a second -- in a number of <unk> create a pack of photons from just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, one million times faster than a common bullet than a bullet one.
If we took that bullet and this pile of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you go around those photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel on the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coke didn't have this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a photons pack that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally gets to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that's bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the insights in the top of the top of the bottle, and after a number of boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we took a <unk> and common bullet and make it run the same distance and we see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much think it would take us sit down to see that movie?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film -- a little bullet in motion.
What about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves of the <unk> from the tomato table, and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, thinking, from a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of events.
But if you look at one more time this soup, you'll realize that, as the light gets rid of the <unk> it's still bright. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is bounces on its inside and it turns out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture of a <unk> it goes very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest show -- so I can barely get a little bit of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> I showed you.
We can take all of those data into raw raw and <unk>
Superman can be able to fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera there.
So we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works this fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities of it.
It has very good resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects but we don't know what a point corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser, you can record a picture in the <unk> which you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's around the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood of this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new form of visualizing to solve the problems of conflict in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself was a scientist, he turned the science to art, a art of photographs of pictures.
I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to see that we can see it.
To create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and colored colors.
And look at those waves remember, the time between each of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But here is also a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you're getting away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved this image.
The order that the events are happening in the world sometimes have invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding feature of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone, your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, your song, to <unk> and be famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who are a mobile phone on here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> a Blackberry, wow!
That's a lot of today to have a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Right?
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every Internet provider in all of Europe, has to store a broad range of user information.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of the Berlin street, and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, which please get me <unk> all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're holding my life.
So I decided to give you a criminal lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
Will the demand and they would send me the information that I would <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly ones in brown with a CD in it.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand dollars of information.
At the beginning, I saw it and I said, well, it's a huge archive OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> We did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and zooming out and go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other what they call the <unk>
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if I had known to her, he had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, not every one of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to get them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and that it's not ever since.
When you go home, you go to your representative that just because companies and government agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what data you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that will give you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Jay <unk> What's going on?
It's not enough.
Jay <unk> What's going on?
My name is <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.

The P. C. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> nor can it <unk>
No one was <unk> the uterus, of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were prime cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, how that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration, and I don't want any of us in this room.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish to be a disabled person.
Go for a walk.
<unk> of Christmas, are in the shopping center, drive in circles and search for parking lots, and what do you see?
And 16 empty places for a syringe.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. <unk> is just one of them.

I'm a Muslim <unk> women, female, and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood, and my disease had the same initial principle.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk> se puede" moment.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters went to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they were afraid that I was out of it, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all of it, all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> in their feet and just walking.
The other tactic that I used was to hang up a dollar in front of me so that we would get it.
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the family kindergarten was walking as a baseball champion who has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
There are now 20 Arabic and still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of a lot that died of hunger during the <unk>
And I would tell them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating -- so <unk> of dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy -- so they sent me to school school.
I learned to dance <unk> or I can walk in <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> me as well.
And when my friends went to the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
And I was spending my summers in a war zone, because my parents were worried that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On the summer vacation often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk <unk> I would wear warm cups on your back, <unk> me on the <unk> Sea and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedy comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can stand on the head.
My parents will come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, University of Arizona, because it was in all <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater.
All of my mind.
I did all the tasks of the least <unk> I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass zoo my <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow on Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> at the end will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater, crying to historically, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't make the stunt fight.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role that literally had been born and gave him to an actress without cerebral <unk>
college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors without disability for a disabled person.
When I graduated back home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that <unk> <unk> <unk> didn't white, <unk>
They just appealed to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comic comics from New Jersey to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that took when he was going to high speed on the highway in New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs in all the United States, and also in Arabic, in Arabic in the Middle East, and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women aren't fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and I will remind the <unk> of <unk> and Arabic, not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight to the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program with Keith <unk>
I went into a graduate dance and I went to a study and they sat down in a <unk>
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the bank desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, was <unk>
I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I would not get to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like I was <unk> at the full time and pasted my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or no longer than the old girl.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist.
What disease is that?
We really should pray for it.
A sample suggested even I would add my disability, to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say they don't have to, but I'm here in front of you.
And yet, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need any society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> who was a charity to give the Syrian refugee children, a tiniest part of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me living in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
My name is <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child from a young people.
I don't know her name, but I know her story.
She lives in a little village of <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a little town to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without it, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunities, there is no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day I read about a gentleman offered him to <unk> him after dinner, <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to get bought new clothes, money to send home, to her family.
They present a young lady.
Finally, they go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life target.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts into a bomb car.
That little boy in that little town with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child in a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that he arrived.
This was the first thing that he got out of what we call "the period of <unk>
And your story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> in London, who are looking for something beyond <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's the youth that suffer from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't have them -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terror, to violence, to the <unk> will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, you know, 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't pretty much do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital in the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital I was going to say, thinking, "Well, if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor juvenile leaders on a business.
<unk> to about 90 juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a <unk> of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a college student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect perfect for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people will be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business business.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until Mohamed came, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from overseas.
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
Started a company from <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for Facebook, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first <unk> public park.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young families, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't carry pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for a NGOs, working for the government, but their story, their own innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, who might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people to create a culture of entrepreneurship is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation in development and put in their business.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, and they need the support that they need to move from understanding the creation of the creation, and you will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> is how it calls it when it's created, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about the <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area of the New York state.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was making the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not the way that we <unk> we almost can pretend that we were the first human beings in <unk> that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with an apple hearts -- <unk> and <unk> balls.
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had <unk> who thought he was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was getting a little bit <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter as a <unk> or where you do -- the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> has clean our trash, and it is about 11 tons of waste and two thousand tons of products coming up every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and truck on their pathways, and I interviewed people in the office and facilities throughout the city, and I learned a lot, but I was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working as <unk> of trash.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was <unk>
And they operated the mechanical and the mechanical <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong -- it's very quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were kept <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and in traffic all the same day, and they see you all around you.
They just want to <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
It will never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always has to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the waste of waste is the most important workforce in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They are the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient way and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their container and its dangers inherent would threaten us in very real ways.
And that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for what the motors engines begin to fail when it's in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just put his relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed of daily rate.
I mean simply at the speed as we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually didn't care about it, or <unk> or we took us with us our coffee, our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use it, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a job force on the other side that we would take out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They are almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always to stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and he went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of <unk> as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I began to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's go right.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I began to research the waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> We work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we must include and have to account all the cost -- even the very real human cost of labor.
The city waste, what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection to thinking about our communal life, making part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
So I brought up two recent projects that I had this example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives -- become an essential part of the state of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> coating generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's one worth being so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really upset with the old market that is this structure in the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site the website, which is located in a very much growth zone of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, not exist in the image.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a stretch of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the inputs from the building.
And this is spreading with <unk> <unk> which creates an open space in the building that would spread through their own sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue <unk> <unk> in order to allow the air entrance, and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside of the building to light the building at night.
So with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall. It was not what they <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because in the end of there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade that was much more economic not only because of the material in comparison with the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy to the building in a city where the electricity is short, almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis creation.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water from the inner <unk>
It waits for the beginning of the next year, because we're going on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention on the <unk> a year of ancient ancient years that was surrounded by a wall with a dozen access doors associated with almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first piece of design we did was to expand the existing streets, creating 12 early blocks similar to the size and features in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic dots in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate itself.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would give you a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density at the upper levels and a smaller density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do activities like running a <unk> career in the morning or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment and that have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had very bright <unk> and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed up with me after the <unk> of school. It was a little evening, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the board of my master's teacher <unk>
And then, I did.
<unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just some of this.
All the same thing.  And I set up to bring it back to the book, but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all over <unk> and myself.
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk>
I never got to me.
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered with this little girl, so small to <unk>
<unk> our jealousy.
They are so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. Birds <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory that we are studying <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it is an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> <unk>
There are no Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school -- because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Not <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in the age of jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year you meet 100 years of his work <unk> "In the <unk> <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from the ordinary <unk> my God, all we could have.
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as strong as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat calls are, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy that you cut into the person, to their desire, their <unk> are a very good <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel organized, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being in the storytellers and audience -- we know exactly what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give to each other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his lover -- it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break out with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotional emotion, you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> <unk> language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his mother's agony of soon listening to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then they defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're research with real value.
<unk> is trying to show that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a real painful truth, and in fact, what it was to <unk> <unk> the more painful truth better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the <unk> of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to suffer, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a much deeper range of feelings much more profound and vital than a wise man who can be able to get there.
We're telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement -- our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at very dry intensity as well.
Freud write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud would say that there was something weird on that man, he didn't know what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion with no cause.
But he was looking for things that did his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or literally accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are made to look with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts of or illegal.
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about my case at 8 years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 year-old woman was captured by having created a false focus on Facebook from which he would send a little bit <unk> to themselves, for a year.
This is a year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- if you will, creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> Mr. <unk> <unk> books that are trying to be able to capture our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to <unk> or want you what you have to invade your self and get it out of what you ever do, and it's under the floor, <unk> your name, takes your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all the world, as much as I want to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asked for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius genius, but it does it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but we <unk> it and <unk> them with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> once you put it up, you walk in, <unk> to all of your solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there's no person in <unk> <unk> who doesn't want to get your hand.
It's one of the very few times that we see <unk> transferred in the story. I find this scene very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> lets you admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple.
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the plans for <unk>
So as we hope that happens, we need to remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Just fiction -- the jealousy.
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel Proust
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 in 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the gray surface, it was the culmination of a collective process <unk>
The Apollo program was the greatest decrease in peace times in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to a 400,000 people and asked 20,000 people, and asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies and government.
They died people, including <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program, 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, of which I stood behind death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have brought a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would climbing the most <unk> mountain.
Thirty-five years ago, why to fly on the <unk>
Why is Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> The <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the strongest emotion was <unk> at the moment of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> Alvin in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship -- but in 1969, the <unk> of Apollo 10 flew 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than about Apollo <unk> and <unk> optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems we imagine that we imagine that technology would solve like going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to have a clean <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that we didn't go to the <unk> tube <unk> the Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I could see colonies on Mars.
So that somehow occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard about all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like if the technologists had distracted us and enriched toys with trivial, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed for <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, that we <unk> that have been created as much as a less ambitious companies that have been created from the years that they are <unk> Microsoft, <unk> Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are all <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs to them.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment led to the creation of <unk> ideas for funding problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their peak without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit of technology as energy, that they need a huge amount of capital and which development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated, and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you can.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption is coming from sources of renewable energy as the solar system, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is entirely economic control.
<unk> and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want choices sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are aware of what political policies and international treaties <unk> the development of a <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy policy in America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, turns out not to be.
We know for a long time that famines are a result of failure in the route of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like we harvest it, or systems for the storage and food route, but there will be massive famines as there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon gave the war to cancer in 1971, we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population of the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it happens with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and it's dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of fiction science as the one of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't miss the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a large decline in trust, it's a very general belief that is an absolute belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and a task, which I think gives you a better idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It starts to think that it may have fallen down in some of the activities or institutions and that could be increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can turn into opinion polls and watch polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still pretty <unk> the judges, nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost just halfway along the road.
But this is this evidence with enough?
What public opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you're looking at is the attitudes <unk> that the people doing it when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> at the <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> by asking, "What does what?"
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them, but elsewhere not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel by a certain kind of official type, officer or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all the cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain teacher in elementary school I know to give the class of reading, but in no way to drive the <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to bring the good judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is <unk>
And I think those people who were saving their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, I think they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it -- he says, yeah, yeah, that's what matters in the first place is not trust, but the trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust her, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in contrast, you're not responsible for the other hand, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that I can get your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for me, but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I don't have to be <unk>
But that's what we're going to do, you know before trust.
Music is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier the task to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make your mind <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the system of accountability is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people that have to do hard work, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know the similar examples.
They were doing all that, through the target.
And I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they were going to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people who are reliable and if other people, whether other people, <unk> or political or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which is not doing properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to make the trust.
But trust -- ultimately is defining because we give us the <unk> other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give you the databases so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you should also be able to bring <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That gets every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very well.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks say I can do it without giving explanations.
And I carry it up and get me the money, or they change it by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they were very vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're going to do is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is about relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginnings of computers we have come out of <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes deeper into digital space, so when the strong <unk> against the display of your physical body to pixels.
The designers can tell their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs, under the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside of the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the division of donor Science division along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a <unk> digital area.
<unk> a little transparent bombsight with deep cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise your hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and emphasize lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we were going on in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make digital information to us?
<unk> many of us will afford to afford and return things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so that we can be able to get it back and <unk>
How would a future be?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator, <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And when we develop the object, we set up from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be <unk> and <unk> and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically physically and distance and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can play it as a physical reality of the physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physics.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us having to <unk> our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if you hit that barrier, the only limit that stays with is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school to athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
Then of surviving the American Revolution, they believed very strongly that there was just an important way to <unk> a safe and safe work <unk>
No matter if I want the job or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera,
This was me in my imaginary piano.
One of the opera singer has to start with <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult had the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends -- but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life -- a second class happiness was the only thing that could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books going on here?
The ones that were <unk> of course, in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is a Chinese Chinese life.
And it's not <unk> a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and his mother."
<unk> I said. "This is so different, and so much better I <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this trap. de <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also gave me a place of reading <unk>
They put a lot of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning this map I found myself out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I'd never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are the research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual people.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk>
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling alone or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 26 year-old woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> he ran the shoes of my office took off the shoes and told me I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it got me easy to just move the head while they would bring the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> saying, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after, they get home later, it has children later, until death happens.
For <unk> as Alex and I had a time of <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> invited me to press Alex that I'd talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like she was going to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, it's still not, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
Also, the best time to work in marriage is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they did, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And then I realized, that this kind of benign occupied was a real problem and had real consequences not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million people in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody gets to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! These are amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take a <unk> you take a <unk> I want to see -- it's good. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that shape your life will have happened to be about 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> I can't panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we would have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> over their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common life has an <unk> impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear about often is that there's something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what people are listening.
The newspapers are talking about changes in the line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> gave them <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you flip a <unk> in your head and say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and nothing wrong with nothing.
And then all the day every day, young people like you or their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count, I'm not killing time."
Or they say, "All they say when I start a career before 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better clip that I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the play game.
Everyone ran and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it's not <unk> the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge pressure on the old ones, and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, to choose a partner, and to have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do all of the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was he doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, which showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few <unk> very difficult, their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then he got up in the way, <unk> don't pick your family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and he cried for almost the time.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning with his many <unk> but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after words -- please call <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I would say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I worked with Alex like I was just sitting while the 1930s.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to get rid of that identity crisis, and the identity of identity.
For capital capital, I mean making something that add value to your person.
Doing something is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't tell -- which by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds that are limited to who you know how to know it, how do you talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person with who comes out almost always comes from the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call strong ties friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the people have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half wasn't, and the weak links are the way we <unk> to this group.
Half of the working jobs never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is a way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed you don't pick your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was growing, Emma was going to lead to his family, when you have a partner and we form his own family.
I told Emma the time to choose his family had arrived.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit down and keep the 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook start walking into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that involves being as intentional in love as you're at the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or kill the time with anyone who is that you will give them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went through that <unk> and she found out to the <unk> of a cousin who worked in a museum art in another state.
This weak link helped us get a job there.
That supply of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend that I live.
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> in museums.
This married one who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I was sending me a letter that said, "Now the emergency room room is not enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport, of Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good <unk> a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea that was worth spreading to all the people who know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity capital and use their bonds -- weak them, choose your family.
Don't let it be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27, I left a very tough job in <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach the mathematics of seventh degree in the public schools in New York City.
And like any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I make tasks.
When I went back, I would listen to grades.
What struck me about the I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have scores of I.Q. <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was so convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time for enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know about how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick way, and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do in the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in very difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the more effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We partnered with a fellow asking yourself, which from these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that children who had more determination had significantly greater likely to get older, even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the testing -- even the security results that they were in school.
So it's not only the West Point or in the <unk> National <unk> where it matters <unk> it's also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know about the science of the developing science.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a ethical job of work?
How do I keep them motivated by the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are just not going ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, causing it is commonly related or it's even related to the other <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions -- and we need to do it.
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to start to start to start everything back with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed for this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> like the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be helpful.
Since I was five years old, I began to learn how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned a new characters every day for the next 15 years.
We only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> traffic signals, and understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how this method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it can be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides as if I were yelling at it, <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> the shape of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks behind, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is company, three are a crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a rebound, just like <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth over the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a tree speaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out of the horizon.
One door. Put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> on the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful is <unk>
So we've been for almost 30 characters.
When we use this method, the first eight radical breakthroughs will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed in the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So one sun along the beginning, create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two <unk> stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become a date.
A mouth that tells you to where it comes out is an <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
And the movie is his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and lead a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of a kind of complex <unk> of child's fantasy.
However, the magician magician was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> who <unk> a metal kid and a guy who was <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician magician and all the films that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling prophecy.
<unk> shoes to defeat the armies were made by evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
The only one thing about the magician magician is that the most African-American characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I saw "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
It's only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  So he was so happy in the room and I was impressed by a mom as a foot with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be issues, <unk> and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke got a military to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of <unk>
How do I win Dorothy your movie?
We do good <unk> with all of them and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be able to grow up, and not a world of men who are <unk> that is where we are.
Why is it so much of the strong <unk> of the <unk> strength in the movies for our children, and so little of the way of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess <unk> don't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that is <unk>  I think at the time of the first minute, I was actually hoping that the credit <unk> will come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like for being a child, you have to be a stupid animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are many exceptions, and to defend <unk> of Disney at any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they guys, they're not really their target audience.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend out the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war film.
Of course, the most successful subject of all time continues to appear in classic after classic every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who raised a child.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you -- it's available in shops.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost any of these movies happens for <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not getting roots and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of film assessment that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there are more women's character than it has <unk>
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things between them.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> success from <unk> a consensus idea of what a movie Hollywood movie is.
<unk> doesn't happen to <unk>
And I don't think it's because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors, to get a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 popular films -- how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one in the United States, one of five women has been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the life of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I also also believe that video videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I listen to that statistics one of the things that I think is there is a lot of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very amazing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools. We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that we would ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own <unk> power.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our kids a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> character of Star Wars <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to get their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I read to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked like their job is joining a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked was to look for the sea fortune on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was reminded of <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I was seeing with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 1.3 miles of length.
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern regions of Egypt called <unk>
And place, it seems to be brown but when we use infrared and process using false color, suddenly the place looks like a brilliant pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old city town called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place fits in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art, <unk> architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> them in the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge underground of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to the east and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And I'll try to find a chance to be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So we use data NASA <unk> to make a map, with a very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this little little area that looks inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of showing in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look at layers of human occupation and we look at layers of human occupation and we look at layers of human occupation and we look at layers of human occupation and we look at layers of human occupation and we look at layers of human occupation and we look at
Five meters down, below a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years ago that date from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same time we think it's <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle East, these are the stones that were <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back the Middle Empire on this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't have to find it <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire of the Middle Empire -- probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to this way: TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually started in 1984 later in 1984 <unk> in a lost city, not for a lost city and found from the high.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk> home.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
And now we <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race race and they go in the direction of their entry door door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> are <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bikes flying all over the place, wheels that pass on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in the <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
In the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light -- the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> waving with your hand.
from his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is speech.
They can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
They can smell the <unk> <unk> and you go to point in the mouth.
They went through one side and trained her living room.
Already in the room, and doing much use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The land has been coated with a <unk> path and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
So I want to tell you about a particular contest that is conducted every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the best memories <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everyone who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to make these miracle acts by memory using some old old techniques invented two thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that he used <unk> to memorize their speeches and that academic academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have no heard of this <unk>
And we were standing out of the classroom of competition and <unk> who is an amazing and brilliant English and a little bit <unk> and he said, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to have the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a <unk> problem, it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on home, I read a number of treaties on the journal written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined disciplined and <unk> wasn't such a thing as rare as it might like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
They have changed the Earth and I would say that they've changed the cognitive too.
As we have no need to remember, we sometimes seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you're still passionate people about this idea of a disciplined <unk> memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is <unk> on the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: It'll be brains in some sense, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a <unk> <unk> <unk> their brains as they were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that in the memory memory is <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
It actually <unk> or looked at a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as a armed race where each year, someone has a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of cards -- <unk> who he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he was just going to get it.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end of that is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
This is shown by a fancy paradox known as the <unk> paradox, <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say it to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told him that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who told the person he told her job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories you dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> when they come back home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates over two thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring it into a <unk> <unk> a <unk>
He stood up on foot, <unk> his memory poem, and he <unk> and so soon it was the classroom of <unk> <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were granted.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, single survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed my eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he'd been sitting every single time.
I took the relatives of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What I <unk> picked up at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it's that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers, or the word numbers for the word of our colleagues, we have <unk> visual <unk>
If I told you that I had the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would argue that if you told you to say who I was sitting on the horse shirt in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the <unk> <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first dance <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it, the same way he would have done it -- if you had invited them to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of kind of ridiculous, crazy image, crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on your <unk>
And that would tell you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it flies in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word, who will be confused but typical for typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in its memory star.
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got up in this <unk>
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea to write something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when someone else gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there's amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have predicted that I would have heard it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about doing is better and better to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
And I was quite hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses with tape with just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a competitor of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that he could be able to put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize and <unk> and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just a <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a gift -- but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on deeply.
The palace of memory, these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> indeed.
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to be influenced by there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
This is how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what <unk> <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> it doesn't pay attention to the human being in front of us, who walks onto our side -- we will be so <unk> that we don't even think about processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible design capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic -- so we just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony I gave the living room.
And there were every time I was watching television TV, so every time I went from my room and to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I got up, and I was going to go back on a towel on a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not <unk> and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or of areas of areas, but of those connections, emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, and I know what they are going to do, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about that by based on a building a half thousand years ago, by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time ago, a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
And the people who are interacting with, and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> he has this round thing, columns, it brick red -- which they leave is about communicating with this <unk> children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, the other one in 2004, the other library, it looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the current forms of life.
We were going to push it up and we push them so much, we get away from the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you know, you think we feel very well, but we are dead, because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and get back to those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, and we feel like <unk> so we start to experience <unk> we get to swing the pendulum back forward, over and over and over and over and over again.
Well, it was 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
It's really very hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add mice, and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
nuts.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies that these fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian one.
Maybe with a little bit of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, <unk> memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols we have now with new design techniques we have been on a computer, and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few shapes that are attached to other ways.
This is an academic <unk> and <unk> and it's super <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened.
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of these rare moments when academic critics and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York Times Guardian <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased by a half thousand percent when we finished the building.
So suddenly, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media got together around them, and we quickly learned that these shapes that culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
They did the world's leading mayors in the world.
They all believe that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new research happened with other star architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through the entire architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about how we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have been walking to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, to move so fast,
It doesn't take a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 buildings, before I had to know if I designed four years ago or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or steel or an elevator.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, and it's going to be on both extreme extremes of <unk> and it's effectively <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge, and something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked at exactly the product, there was not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
They can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there's no answer to what a library might be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions is the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and drawings and you are no longer a <unk> audience who doesn't embrace something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it out of architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings tomorrow will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
So this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical brick of red brick based on what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be transferred to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve for <unk> or <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars from the surrounding community around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this small pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings more <unk> and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want.
Finally, we're not in opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot to play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the <unk> spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we go to our children, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year, and he started walking.
And it does it from that great way, a typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves those big kisses <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of your friends do this and my mom will tell me that I used to do it. And I think, "How do you try to do this?
How is it that we suddenly don't love with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
He's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells her all the time that he is beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
And what his mom says to him and what his friends, or fellow school colleagues say, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and asks others that please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, which gets these answers into one of the stages of their lives more emotionally.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today almost never are alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like there's a party in your room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures coming from hand with that is <unk>
This environment, of being connected to being connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the biggest impact on someone in the life of someone in the front of what it's normal in a particular context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the girls right now.
<unk> six is still <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And the trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people looks like.
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes in sports and the singers, <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and are very good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their look, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how to rescue society and the field of development development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in arguments in class. <unk> to participate in the classroom <unk> because they don't want to call care of their physical things.
One in five are not going to classes at all over the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you look good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're going to be enough enough to give you a note on the average of your fellow people who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland in America and China, in China.
And it goes regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about as you see you -- not how you're really like.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> girls are doing less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, involved in more diet not healthy that they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what is making decisions more <unk> like the consumption of alcohol and drug consumption -- diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relations and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that work?
<unk> this potential is for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first one is we need to instill trust in your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many available programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very amazed at me when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it.
So we must make sure that the program that follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial points for any willing to provide education in body self-esteem that works.
A education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take the regulations on the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count on the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge the people by what they are, not because of how they look like.
All of us can begin to do that by assuming the responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their own effort and actions and not as appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time I was <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up to grow their whole person to be valuing the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put people that are really making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make a difference in the great screen, because we just will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are going to be seen never the <unk> of being who they are, or of reaching what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who have to mind?
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
It was <unk>
He <unk> their <unk>
It could be just the woman who is going to two seats at a distance. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, which I would read him for you not to have a long legs, she would get more <unk> a <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for it if we were going to give us this, and we'd say free to unlock that way?
Right now, the obsession with our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's take our children the truth.
And you know, the way you see you is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
It would take the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
So let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, becoming a lot of insurance for themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the top of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi who was <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
<unk> was initially innocent enough, but being prisoner by other charges <unk> in the company of others, they started planning to plan attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans would spread by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center could not escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my dad.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who was a <unk> an American mother, an American mother, teacher school teacher who had all the possible thing for me for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, you don't need a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of human group, there's always a tiny fraction of people who are so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all possible means so that everybody lived as them.
A few months before he arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to training training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that without knowing our group was spreading through the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me to hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise all of all, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned back to the other and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. but just a few years later I understood what it was so funny.
Did you see the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people would be convicted to be convicted of putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> meaning uncle.
When I was 19, I had moved to me 20 times, that instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone already was a moment to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> my identity to avoid being the white person, but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was spending it on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
And for these reasons I didn't have social skills, to say that <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
And I said, opera, judging the people, based on <unk> indicators like race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that I set up to test my way to think was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done friendship, was Jewish people.
And I took a number of days out of the light that I realized there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in the Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I was able to see that several of them were the nicest and less critical ones that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat fellow people, exactly the way I wish we wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is being <unk> but I know what is being written by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with the character.
In many ways he became my <unk> figure at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasions, inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless eyes and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I have done it because I hope that someone, one day is to try to lead the violence, I can hear that there is a better way -- that even though I get to this nonviolent ideology, and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against the biases.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
Because of the victims of terrorism to talk against those acts without sense, like rejection of my father.
With this <unk> I put it here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is involved in your minds.
This is an amazing movie.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
Do you feel your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood who project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly <unk> in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in it.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths to be human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film -- your tea and you.
There is nothing to make them more directly.
At least I know I have an <unk>
I have no sure that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not conscious, anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are going to be <unk> what we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, because of nature, is objective here.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
Then there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the whole 20th century, that vision.
psychology is studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but never nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists as Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science to be <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limits to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something from this guy on the fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of people, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers a few questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what makes certain areas of the brain and what it was <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to <unk>
Actually, there is no problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a film internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emergent phenomenon, like <unk> like life -- and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do we operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are adapting and <unk> the living organisms, all are questions about how to target it.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we are talking about, how we do -- how we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, it doesn't really have no longer to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it would work. It was beating me head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to be involved in this point.
We have a wonderful explanations chain, we get used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
For another, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need to have ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
And his crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of subjective subjective film, includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is study everything that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is quite close to simply denying the observation of consciousness is satisfying
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time you left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic stuff.
On the contrary, they are considered principles, and that's where the world builds up.
Sometimes, the list of the key <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of space -- space -- time, dough, <unk> laws of Newton. So I applied the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation we found ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, mass dough, charge, then for a matter of logic, you have to do the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it is not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other core concepts -- space, time, mass processes physical.
physicists sometimes say that we want to want fundamental fundamental laws that we can do it in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we can do it in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> all of all, <unk> by mind, every system is aware, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I will never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling, they will give you some kind of primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy to you.
How would anyone think about something so <unk>
And part of this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is fundamental stuff.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass -- it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us -- that's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more like a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking about the physical process, is to be able to get consciousness with information.
There's always information processing, and there is awareness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human being, complex awareness.
<unk> simple information -- simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high-level degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half of information integration, as well as a very significant degree of consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller -- but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of consciousness different from scratch.
It actually brings up a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality of the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From <unk> <unk> the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have quite serious social consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I had nothing to eat nothing to have consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think of thinking about this, it tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not so much the fact about consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated processing processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious of you.
If this is right, they are involved with very serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
And I'm actually more sure of the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a universal thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and we love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a serious awareness theory.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we will finally be able to figure that out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village at Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a under education.
I went to school, I was excited with my friends, my younger men.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for an award for a community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a evident.
She didn't actually get anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school school was just after about 20 minutes in the class of 11 studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when you will give your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When the people in the wheels, they talk about things like <unk> at school?"
<unk> in the classroom of <unk>
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability like <unk>
And we don't are. And it's not because of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability aren't our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to be there.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to hear them, right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lie in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something -- <unk> <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability you make you fantastic stuff.
It's not something wrong and it doesn't make you fantastic things.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hand drawing with a pen held by his mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we would get a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I would encourage the disability to the benefit of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad what my life might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the realization of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my job had a public profile.
It was like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images, those images are going to get people with disability on the people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They are not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was fascinated by the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here in the inspiration, and you think, "Oh my God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I'm lucky, you know.
<unk> this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect the things they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to upload the battery of the mobile phone on the battery of your chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance from others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us the hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a stretch of the stairs has not made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> for the <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting on his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> don't consider any of it to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at the age of 11 degree in Melbourne is not a little surprised than their new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about it is that it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today will just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of actually <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we really get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of the game to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
We can know that it feels like a black man of 110 pounds -- <unk> trying to do it with all of their self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So let's get a few videos to show you what this is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible being <unk>
A little bit <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of these <unk> of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to feel like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or from a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get out of <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you already know about.
The National <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller Russian mountain <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of being like.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball over the network?
What will be your experience when you get a mountain at more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality augmented the augmented reality when the <unk> and owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives money.
So, here is a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore were placed a <unk> to their field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to your group, and you see their next turn in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're wearing in front of you, you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
It just goes out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate losing games.
If you lose party parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good ones will know that we will know.
The bad ones will have <unk> of information.
This is going to take good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just to <unk>
It's also going to be <unk> Who would you have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver out of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> they don't <unk> but the system of <unk> you <unk>
They were going to take the area of protection.
Another <unk> will tell you that there's an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the way from each angle.
This is something that creates massive excitement on the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> as our entertainment <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings to show someone how it is, literally, being in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much this technology is worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are their actions from <unk> perspective.
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is also worth <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality comes over.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, we face -- as a matter of us.
Thank you.
I was recently <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years had been inspired by the southern end of the <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to the world of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much at <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped into their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single one from he releases all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass it under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water roughly 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bones, some of which will be vital organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones who didn't, they usually fall into the water and then they were <unk>
I don't think that the people who will embrace this method of suicide is going to realize the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people get before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man talked to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with <unk> that we had a success day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal <unk>
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those that <unk> the suicide, but the officers too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, ethnic officials and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met this last year 22 last year by receiving a call from a possible suicide bomber called the <unk> near the <unk>
<unk> and when I came here, I watched Jason <unk> talking to an official of the Golden Gate bridge.
Jason was just 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, it had been flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could tell you about it, and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and you don't have <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> he leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of smart kind of New Jersey in New Jersey had just had to get her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had had their order.
<unk> damage affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What <unk>
What to say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you need to hear it.
Listening to understand.
They don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you don't have to be afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have been thought to end up and have had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it may save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to the <unk> social <unk> and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking, I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go back home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police police and they <unk> it as he disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was below the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I wrote to a radio call by a possible legal subject on the sidewalk sidewalk close to the north.
<unk> my bike. I watched this man, Kevin <unk> of foot on the sidewalk.
When I came up to me, cross immediately <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and a half a day, I heard like Kevin talked about their depression and <unk>
Kevin decided on his account that day to come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin turned out to her, he <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made you <unk> and gave the hope and give life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Do you <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother and Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the events of the 11th in March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was ready for help.
He's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I heard Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
I became a lot of debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she write, <unk> When I visited San Francisco from San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I did have to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and the active member of society.
It talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got <unk> poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, my own pain, a chance to meet me.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt someone else.
They just want their own chest pain.
And usually this is achieved by three things: sleep or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved involved in involved with just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand on three times.
In the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two -- most of those people have said that the second thing that they end up the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge doesn't only connect with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be striving for doing.
suicide can be prevent.
There is help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you know what you don't are, but inside your inner you know what you are, and a question will you tell you, how do you lie on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I was finally able to get the dream that had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this photo, I'm thinking, <unk> you know, <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of skin or by the beliefs of those of us around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, my even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I was always wearing this shirt on his head.
And my mom was wondering, "Why always have that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, is my hair -- I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I thought it's going to be a bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank you to be a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess of <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines of these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing of man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she went through the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and I got a third fact: between over 40 candidate terrorists.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was about Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess of everything when we went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, he called me and he told me that they passed my app to live in the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "Do you know that if you get to the America you can change the name and the identity <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also stayed with me when I was <unk> in Thailand at the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the rural cities of Thailand to do the most sophisticated surgeries and safe and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of the name <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked at me.
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in lived in his truth, but that <unk> put in order to her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
And all of the ages of November we make a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage thanks to a long history of people who were <unk> and stood up with injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame or fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more <unk> of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you to all my <unk>
My parents especially, my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have been young women, and sometimes when they were calling me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it, and I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other not. It's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table of a few times that sometimes that assignment didn't block, and there should be a space that would allow people to go, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
It should have understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many tribal societies, and tribal societies, parents are usually familiar with their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, the <unk> National Prize of peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you had a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, the inequality and exploitation.
You see, in today's societies, right from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome, nor for her father, or for her mother.
The neighborhood comes, it gives your <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother gets a lot of a lot for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter. <unk> <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of their brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it's 13 years old, you get a grant from your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if they were <unk> the code of that honor, you could even kill.
And it's interesting that this one of the honor code doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of his father and mother and <unk> decisions even if you don't will.
If you did it with a man who doesn't like it, or if he <unk> it with an old man, it has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> her daughter and the same lesson of honor to his kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters when he was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was thinking, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and he grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal countries, in tribal countries, it's a great event for life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
One to school means it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for the future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of tourist <unk> and it was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document in any document in any document in all.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to show them in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I trained my daughters, taught the students, to forget the <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomena.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in the political and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Some girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, was offered her same for New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and on the October nine of 2012, they fired <unk> on the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would get her to my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, to your <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't give you <unk>
<unk> the fair cause of it.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These little words that are very much for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains and severe headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was being bent by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please be <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't finish his task.
They fight with their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special on my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk> and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did before I was joining Google or outside my work there.
So having said this, there is a stigma when you give you a <unk>
Are you just like smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if they didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix up of chemicals, and try to convince them to stay alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that we would try to get the doses of it, because it really doesn't have a clear map that does it in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how little changes in the dose fundamentally dramatically -- my sense of who I was, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried to have a cutting-edge dose for a glimpse and I was surprised to see how I was doing my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit of <unk> fixing a problem that I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience that I gave myself a new appreciation about men and about what they have to do, since I have better with men.
What I tried to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, I was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I would think of almost always in images, and that became my point of key <unk> how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in similar form.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are the people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works. This is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right and I've got a lot of great mental <unk> really sophisticated -- really sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images to my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use his imagination only to drive the world to the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way people creative can get to share the speed of light.
And the fact is, the only difficulty to achieve this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that was done by two groups that have been taken from the top of the individual <unk>
Both of them used MRI technology, image fMRI to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The column of the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual while they were <unk> watching that same image.
The column on the right became <unk> the content of the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This was <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn the brain waves in visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos, while they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of reactions in the brain in the video sequences of the video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information of scanning the scanning of the scanning of what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're right about doing this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image, and when you imagine that same picture, you create the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning systems of the largest resolution systems today, and their resolution as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer myself for that.
A lot of them are proposing new projection techniques by imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next one, this technology will be the end of the way the way the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> they only offer little improvements in resolution, not by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of the larger magnets let's make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and bright and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of FM radio in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field they are able to put together magnetic patterns structured patterns into the frequencies of <unk> radio.
So as we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of the patterns of electrical radio processing -- we can increase <unk> and the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
And then we can then divide into layers our increasing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood <unk> but the <unk> of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to bring our ideas into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Of course, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have a few more choices than opening up this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay woman.
I think we all have <unk>
Her "I'm probably telling you to some person for the first time that loves it, or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have to put through your life.
So I'm all a difficult conversation -- and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and left that closet something universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And it will be <unk> in the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I had <unk> my head was a little bit -- I was asked by usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear a uncomfortable silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, it would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and it would look out in it.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a boy between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised my next time I would say something.
It would be that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a kid or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to get on the female issues at the table,  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a glimpse of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took up deep and went down, and I went down and my back, a four-year-old girl, with a pink dress, staring at what is not a challenge for a feminist, a feminist, just a girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And then I took a deep breath again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is pretty messy.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and he saw a little baby clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like you to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more of the kind of girl with a <unk>
And that girl looked at me -- paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> for <unk>
And that's it. I just said, "Well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my "I'm not different from yours or yours or yours.
I will give you 100 reasons why I could get out of my closet more difficult to come out of his, but this is the <unk> it's hard to be <unk>
It's hard to be difficult.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared them in banking is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I story is harder to say to your five year-old son that you're going to get to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classify out what it is difficult for us to do about what difficult for someone else to make us feel better or worse in relation to our grandchildren, and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years that would go into the coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and moving only muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my family friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turning around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade was in my sister.
It was the first time that many people were invited to be gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally I got to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was <unk>
And after talking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> at Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite favorite show. Will <unk>
And you know who we <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting for desperately to try and try to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but to <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you get.
That's how hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask for anyone that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming out of any <unk> is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no armor but I was ready for battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will maintain the hope that it could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let us complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can be wounded being wounded by what they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something on them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not their own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, you have seen intelligence, a very productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I would have a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental technologies underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the intelligence of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through many disciplines, that I think, I think, to a only underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately accurately in the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will define the diversity of possible states.
Finally, in robotic motion, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked a number of years -- there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the nearest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an <unk> force, which acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize future freedom of action, or keep the open options on the open force, with the diversity of potential <unk> <unk> Yes, to an imminent time, <unk>
In a few words, intelligence doesn't like being <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom and keep our options open.
And so having to figure this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
It takes the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have trend more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection, <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find out there.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal, and play games of humans, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that without the fact that they had to do that.
Here's some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole with a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for the humanoid and humanoid human technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from extreme extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are continually <unk> and keeps the very successful net going on.
This is the same capacity for network <unk> it also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
Here we look at <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under their space change.
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance, and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all flow of one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom in action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work was always the concept that if you were doing smart machines, there'd be a <unk>
Machines get against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually become <unk> instead of being upside down.
Another significant consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, the following: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that is trying to maximize future freedom of action and avoiding the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the empowerment of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler assignment of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim <unk> of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data picked up by Kepler shows the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their parent star.
Together, this helps us to understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
Instead, this makes clues about whether these planets that we find are livable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused to a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist or the weather, or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I'm looking for the planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the only discovered and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world that has been shown by a mission like that.
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part of it, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images <unk> you remind the deserts.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places and <unk> of the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests at thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will come up with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is really livable the Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration of exploration -- I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there to <unk> humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the preservation of the Earth is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain spaces that are <unk> in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment with <unk> <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, <unk> in mind that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets are going to protect the origin of the planets that we have to protect this development.
It's arrogant to think that only quantum colonization, will save us from ourselves, but the planetary account and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to bring the hostile environments on Mars to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized he didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window who were at the table, where I had them <unk> them.
So quickly tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all right up.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff <unk> because I had a flight early in Europe in the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport.
They were expensive, but it's safe than a <unk> at half night, so I thought, even though I thought, even in the circumstances, very well stopped.
I'm a neuroscientist, and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, and <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in their place, which would be able to show bad things.
Or at least if you look at bad things, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe is going to happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winning the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and then Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> like it explains <unk> you look at it, and you try to figure out all the things that might be wrong, then trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, it will be a place for things that lose very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the very important things, where the fish are, where the fish -- that places the <unk> trees -- where the female tribes live, and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone actually did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose your car keys and read it.
So in the house I took a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer for it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all your things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone -- a picture of your credit card cards from driving, passport, please hate themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care care or a loved person, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take out of the <unk> a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of infectious diseases, a brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol isn't the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have already heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most important drugs in the world today -- even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask for most doctors don't want to talk, and companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who need to take a drug or have a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's guilt -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> <unk> which do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before they help one person.
300.
This according to the research in the <unk> researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I will explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before you avoid a single heart attack, stroke or other <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 to get my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic -- and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in the five percent of patients.
And those include things like <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they're thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still take <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how to deal with the time, so you don't have to make the string of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
One has 15 times more likely to get out of the drug to help you get a drug.
I don't say they had or not to take <unk>
I'm just saying you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The ethical ethic is that it is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men from 50, <unk> from prostate prostate men, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is actually 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or erectile <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you might have to make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longest life that might be much pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the <unk> of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn out a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> to face a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, don't react very fast.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking of rational, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to think about this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how you could be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize harm, or to prevent things bad on the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up with a combination of combination next to the door, with a key <unk> to the front door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not quite organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French prison language came over the 1980s, and over the time of time, it came together with local signs, and developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, now I realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following the <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> <unk>
So how do you understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people respond to it.
So I've learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise from eating the bag of chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure you don't have <unk> on the <unk>
All of this is called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound of sound, about which it's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines have already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing this with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to tell me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experiences through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was stuck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and becoming my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, the work and institutions, work with many different performers <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> his voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value as well as to take a loan from a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could do it in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't catch and convey fully on the paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor for us to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk> parameters,
If you <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the facial expression, the movement of the body, the shape of the hand and like that, while it hits the piano, English is a linear language -- as if you get a key to the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers of a place to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If just a key <unk> the chord would create a completely different significance of it.
Same thing happens with the music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters that are <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you reading?
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the glasses of music?
So if I had to create a sign and you took it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is all day."
If you get it, and you measure the speed, visually <unk> looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands on the present time and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and a very dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands.
We are now going to do that as much in my head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a point is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest but they transmit very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn it, not to learn to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never knows, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you take them all, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because the adults were lied to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults are also <unk> and that they're not really good at cleaning the others.
The country, now I'm adult and teach citizenship and invention in the Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach with lots of garbage.
So as a good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a little bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we have been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those plastic bits in order to look under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's too expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> job <unk> so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'll tell you children who are using electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of using plastic pieces, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with the robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in the creation of prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned on light lamps and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of image by the robot.
We see the plastic bits floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board is processing this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was able to investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
Do you see the news <unk> <unk> the Internet, and it gets <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe less than 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk>
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water goes down, the water where you live.
You can also see that water is brown and the oil and the oil are also color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
So we built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
I was doing this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and <unk> and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he had a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant to Fukushima, nuclear power plant with the water.
And today, according to the reports that 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the most part, it has to be sure, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and independent independently with other scientists, the land, the Earth, and we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course you don't have the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they are going to have to live with <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust gets <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition to the nuclear power to date.
We get to a mile of the nuclear power, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking tracking of as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we converted it into the largest space dedicated to the social impact of the social impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal wood, a little bit of biology, and basically, you can build almost everything out there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the population of the age population transforming their standard wheels in new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizens -- scientists, <unk> <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two very radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of steel parts, the other one of a silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic the other organic.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I believed.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a shape that struggle for being free.
<unk> was only a tool for Michelangelo.
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we carry all of the information required for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been mastered by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world <unk> <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One runs mainly as a <unk> the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a split screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in his simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where they are able to solve four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, of large-scale scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a shopping basis that some day not very far to print buildings -- <unk> and graphics made from <unk> genetically <unk>
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype from the old Arab architecture and has created a screen where every single opening is size of only size to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the naked <unk> around the waist.
Together with a 3D collaborator, 3D collaborator, we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells.
This hull combines <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner too.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the instruments, that enables us to design products that are <unk> not only the way of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic <unk> a chair to the very comfortable structural position, and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator, came back to nature to <unk> and to design this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
The surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by the addition of other material or other <unk> but it will continuously be able to <unk> the material.
But this is the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and he got to define a lot of what matters to me.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree, <unk>
For that first tree there would be no difference between <unk> branches, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of place.
I often ask me, "What would the design would be if the objects were made of a single part?
Let's get a better state of the <unk>
So we would look for the material that we have the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruits, and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of produce every year because organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could <unk> their property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>
<unk> technological concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of property, from dark and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of a single material -- a 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are <unk> you can dry it to find a natural way in contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that first came up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> and if it broadens even more to windows.
A <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of husks of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects that are designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, and <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the board, <unk> did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new biological strands inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is the <unk>
She lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other use of sugar and produce useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the eventual tract -- that will help you bring these bacteria and to make it <unk> their way of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the dominant functionality of the material.
If we wanted more <unk> they had more transparent.
This is a traumatic system when it stretches from one end to another, it goes to 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels living in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What happens if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damaged tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this thing the material.
So you always have to go back to nature.
So you know that a 3D printer printing material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, putting those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk <unk>
However, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different parts -- and we have discovered that the shape of the <unk> structure is transmitted directly through the environment.
Often we <unk> silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot that we had made of silk, making <unk> and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, define silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms to a production of silk farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to be prepared with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the integrity, and he was right.
As biological silk -- biological silk about <unk> <unk> they bring all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit about two or three weeks ago, <unk> silk worms <unk>
In a curious bit of symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 dollars in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a <unk> ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to an nature inspired by the very first time, that demands of us, for the first time, that we do charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can do it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and he had the arts and he had to play the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, it's no longer a challenge, and it comes to <unk>
And I have to move on.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something completely different, and I get rid of it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get a little bit in that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned about being afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to give you back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you did -- they learned that in culture.
So what do you ask is, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they <unk> at that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause answers to the children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow in various shapes, <unk> <unk> high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise, before it takes us the dream.
Why?
So if this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, don't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are going to be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and he's <unk>
And this <unk> editor of magazine converted to <unk> <unk> a creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear about is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up with curiosity and lots of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so on.
It could help if you divide in three <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the stage of the Renaissance, the ideal was that I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewels <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of only by his <unk> a mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is very quick.
When we were <unk> we are interested in something, we're going to do it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> used to have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a kid who was an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it was to become a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability helps you to write a compelling launches for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you're going to do, even if you get it to the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's the ability to transform anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of the other video designer, sometimes a consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take a different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
The magazine <unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex issues, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers not to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The doctor can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a ample amount of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be connected to how we are connected to.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will tell you that they're just more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing you will take out of this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal source, whatever it is.
If you're a heart doctor, then, <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just seen being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep your curiosity from those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a most authentic life and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric person in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but it was <unk> for her until he was unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
I would have been alive if you could have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he was <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have figured out antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's kind of progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of the two.
In other words, there is the probability that you have to spend their years with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or dear Alzheimer's.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it has been relatively little done to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's in spite of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a single number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but all over the world. Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years -- all of us -- of course, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleashed a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reducing the energy expectancy of life and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of proteins.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left in the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
You know, a wire could do anything.
<unk> the other can make the pump down.
So you have to find the right step that you can do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the cables have been reduced by the cables and waited the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, chemicals, <unk> physical engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see it moves normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that we are going to be able to get a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn us that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have taken more research and <unk> over governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the victims hidden, caregivers from their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the neocortical column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love in love to do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I test it myself.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to become more and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be?
Number one: When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to tell your partner what you like to like it, or it -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've just met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, the fact that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect them.
However, we were <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column Love <unk> a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it is now <unk> so I guess some of you probably are asking, they follow all together.
And the reason I think is doing this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the article was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousands of views.
And that has a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was released on a Friday night, and then the Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, already had been called Project Show and "Good <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence writing with it -- about experiencing <unk> experiences, but something else is to discover that life loving a <unk> -- and that the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called, or he had a little bit, what they did every day for weeks -- they were the first question: still the same question: still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman yelled at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
So I think this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times ran a <unk> article for St. <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study on them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very impressed with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> interviews of television, and I would take the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the iconic icons of the process of <unk> -- a range that I didn't feel at least <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know just if the study worked, they wanted to know if I really thought, I mean, if I was able to produce <unk> love, not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship had just a few months old, and I felt, especially that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we were going into it or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions, less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer to doing more close to doing -- several later studies, they used <unk> protocol -- <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used by between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of the <unk> policies.
The original version of the story, which I set up last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he was never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, Do you want to say you're going to tell you the person who you <unk>
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better know better after testing the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult one.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to virtually all my adult life, and he was my first real love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went to science.
I did all I could find about the science of romantic love, and I was hoping that that could be able to be able to make the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just saw this for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I told me with knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably to demand me.
What I'm looking for from love is an assurance -- not only to be <unk> today, and it's going to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story told you about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love it makes us feel <unk> but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story asks still together?
And its content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's ask us to ask questions, more difficult, questions like, How do you decide who they deserve your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love with them when things get together, and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love with it is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
<unk> love because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder to read a little bit about it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I had no thought about everything that was not supposed to be.
I didn't think of a few times we would have both to take that decision, and how much times I have to keep making that choice without knowing before he was always going to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what it does, and what maybe spending my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really write about it.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also is to love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian <unk> and I had a <unk> of the forest.
New York City a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example how we eat your <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all of those things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> when Agnes Martin, the covered in resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened on the opposite: somehow it seemed to scale away from size, as if it was that we could get the text with a <unk>
So I did, I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to figure out stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God, I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens for <unk>
First of all, you will tell you that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exposures and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I became interested in the human form, sculptures of the natural size of human beings with drawings of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing -- I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing on the glass glass of glass, similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that make a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional composition -- which is a three-dimensional composition of three-dimensional events.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has <unk> so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> mesh <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals of animals are running by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the bin bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits up oil in a hand while the other hand gets clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird spike and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail runs fire on a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go forward, you know.
His tail ends in a <unk> eye balloon made from 1986.
They've got them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> or dictionaries or research.
But each acts of as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each is basically a <unk> <unk> which weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to come up with the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover your penis or whatever, or whatever it is you have, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating with each other.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a school, a school, a school arm that spreads all the content that spreads all the way that we do in the world, and a garden.
You know, the box and all of the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box in which you're living on.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug would have any effect on the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are going to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and it will increase the cells of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, <unk> in its much negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the waste <unk> it will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to its destiny, which is where it's most important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. the <unk> system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of the patients that are attached to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs, which is a treatment for life managed by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me: the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and diabetes surgery you can be used for anything else, including the drug transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes that open and close holes -- almost immediately the cells with HIV to introduce drugs.
You ask the best people to say, "What is that <unk>
We sent a little laser beam of laser in the cell membrane on the cellular membrane on HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of descent.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this in vitro technology or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it's going to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head -- a <unk> that distributes your drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again, to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
So my goal is to understand better to these independent agents of violence and study ways of encouraging the transition from violent participation to non-violent <unk>
I do work work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of peace between 1975, and 2011, <unk> had been held between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know how much reasons why they do, how do they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed fight and the policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
Local groups are very complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian Palestinian met by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
Are you multitasking
They had a complex machinery of communication, radio stations, radio channels, TV websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising of hedge fund <unk> but through <unk> business companies for example.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to get better and build their <unk>
The armed groups also make something more, they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run by hospitals, put together in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering the population by offering something that the state of state is not <unk> and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in a Afghanistan destroyed by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an elevated price for the population.
But usually to provide social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario even in the West, when we look at groups -- we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill these gaps for the government, and they emerge as armed as armed groups, participate in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations, are these organizations, less we can measure it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, running all of its <unk> they collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak people are states, like in the Middle East today, plus <unk> and fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools that are not the military <unk>
<unk> that <unk> government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and assessing the peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will understand better than incentives to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but not to give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I was <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and who would have sex.
Today, I see how women treat women around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept I am, in fact, a feminist, and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same times for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as we can be able to be free or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines ...
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We're people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and a lot more.
We need to have to figure out these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of <unk>
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear music rap -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and this offends the <unk> the classic <unk> <unk> of the NSA.
<unk> actually with your <unk> t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you give you the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical promise.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have nothing to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and <unk>
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have <unk> <unk> of <unk> fairy fairy histories.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is rooted in a way that makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color women of color, the workers, gay and <unk> and <unk> for women white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism is a very bad feminist background.
It also happens the following: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
Do we have this tendency to put it out of it, <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we're going to make perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of <unk> from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think of that <unk> before I try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag means is <unk> for the fear of not being able to meet the little realistic expectations of it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it the <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to this pop star to look at this star star to be able to know women and young men who be feminist is something to be proud of it.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started <unk> the endless <unk> whether it was or no feminist.
He would be able to tell your feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection is because we're still fighting for a lot, we need a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're so much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the action to the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear <unk> music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they overestimate the change actually affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions justify it that makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality we all deserve to and is our responsibility.
I think about my three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and shiny and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were told by strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio emitter when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than they like <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially young white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his project, to participate in their project, or to work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of the people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also engage them to be even more like people are reluctant to overcome the barriers to the decision decisions.
We are not <unk> without these efforts, without having these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will get to the top, to the people in the power and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more brave and significant.
We can also claim to bravery our feminism, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> being a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it a incident to address what happened.
Some of the guys would tell me when I was so young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started thinking that was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't believe I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was focusing on a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown.
I read the words of women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to accomplish anything.
And in the other, I hold the tough reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California, they had <unk> to have gone to <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the paper that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines that are called, and marked by being a <unk> fraud by British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines are going to be in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
So the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about she believed to develop all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence are prevalence just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could call it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people in the Center for Disease Control from Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these numbers <unk>
But that kind of language don't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of it.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked, why were they so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened to have less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and what was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 patients who seemed <unk> worlds that seemed to <unk> the people in their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their faces, but they were prey from panic by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the <unk> patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the issue, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we were <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent to his doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents and <unk>
And these kids, he said, they've kept carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't be <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster them in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, determining things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents who had been desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became source for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive psychologist, in London, I thought that the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John were people warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as unlimited without service services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in diverse people.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, <unk> or <unk> <unk>
So these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and they saw a lot more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did anyone didn't realize these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wants to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> in their own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music classes with music, and children followed their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Rather than blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disabilities for life of life that required forms of support and <unk> spaces.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called their little teachers, and he was dedicated to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
<unk> Asperger's has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were ordinary and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> in the pop culture like the <unk> social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> -- by using the limited model of <unk> by one broader and inclusive.
These changes didn't fell in broken up.
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked in front of that, to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards on <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents from everybody knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they were introduced the first big health trials to diagnose autism.
I had no longer to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm from the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics began to <unk> the same way they predicted <unk> and they were hoping that they hoped that people with autism and their families finally support the support and the services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame the vaccines for the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, and <unk> history story as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention is that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic groups are one of the largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are puzzles for the new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that the <unk> for the most invasive aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, community communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we went to the uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
